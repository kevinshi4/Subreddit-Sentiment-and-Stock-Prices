15,1549976493.0,teslas lightning domes vs lightning rods naturally occurring radiation and disease evolution naturally occurring radiation from all sources appears to be able to cause minor radiation sickness that probably increases cancer risk but the even more immediate problem from this is that it plays some role in the evolution of disease including evolving both new diseases and new strains of existing diseases it may play a major role some part of this radiation is from the fast electrons from the radiation belts above the atmosphere another part is from radon and other radioactive decay products emitted from the ground if this hypothesis is correct the increased opening of the ionosphere in the northern hemisphere in the fall that makes the aurora bright at that time also contributes to or causes the seasonal flu this problem should only increase as the geomagnetic field continues to weaken old fashioned pointy franklin lightning rods increase naturally occurring radiation within their vicinity that is among the reasons tesla invented lightning protectors that are essentially the opposite shape teslas domed lightning protector cupolas are extremely blunt flattened paraboloids where lightning rods are very pointy rods the difference between the radii of curvature of the two shapes could not be greater one of the unstated features of teslas nonionizing lightning protectors appears to be reducing naturally occurring radiation in and around buildings first by not being pointy and also by producing a blanket of very slow ions around the terminals this is curiously similar to teslas fountain teslas fountain was designed to use a thin sheet of water around a large perimeter to make a small flow of water look deceptively large us he didnt mention it in the patent for any of a number of reasons but to maximize effectiveness tesla may have intended them to be positively biased with low voltage like around v this battery might need to be removed during thunderstorms because it would explode if it grounded a lightning strike the battery would help increase the emission of slow ions and it would reduce the absorption of ions from above this positive biasing would also make teslas lightning domes the exact opposite of lightning rods in terms of bias potential lightning rods are grounded which is to say biased negatively edit i could be wrong too my idea comes from another patent that appears to be related to tesla but that might not be relevant here another intended benefit that tesla alluded to in the article about them but not in the patent text is to reduce soot from chimneys they would also help to reduce dust from any source with the devices located around the perimeter of the roof a vanishingly fragile blanket of slow ions would tend to repel dust and prevent it from entering buildings like normal there might also be some other things that his lightning protectors were intended to do by virtue of being smooth elevated metal terminals teslas lightning protector us edit the dissipation array systems das used to protect radio antennas from lightning are high efficiency ionizers so they should be much worse than old fashioned lightning rods which are much lower efficiency ionizers being used in proximity to radio antennas should also make das worse too and on a related note the negative ionizers that have become popular since the s are also unexpectedly problematic they can become extremely unhealthy depending on the ambient naturally occurring radioactive decay products in the air where they are used while they can make air feel more refreshing initially they have been found to increase ambient radiation levels where they are used by making naturally occurring radon bind to the walls and ceiling instead of allowing it to float away like the lighterthanair gas that it is apparently thats why it can start to feel weird and unpleasant in areas where a negative ionizer has been used for an extended period of time to be healthy to use negative ionizers should use much lower voltages and they need to consider how naturally occurring radon will effect the operation of the device over time it is much healthier to use the old fashioned method of allowing a small amount of fresh air in to freshen the air than using a negative ionizer to freshen stale air i dont know how much effect it could have on ambient radiation levels if only a single building uses them but if all the buildings in an area replaced pointy lightning protectors ground level radiation levels might be reduced enough to begin to have a measurable effect in health statistics over time another feature of tesla terminals would apparently be to increase earths capacitance i do not know what function this could possibly serve but he appears to have been drawing attention to this feature in the diagrams he did not explain it or even mention it though so its not clear tldr space weather makes us sick lightning rods and some other things make it worse teslas lightning terminals were intended to overcome this defect and also serve some other interesting functions

7,1490207424.0,nobody else finds it strange tesla was purged from us history after ad having been a student for quite awhile of what really happened to tesla after wardenclyffe it still took me many years to realize tesla was systematically purged from us history after he was publicly ridiculed for almost years before his death then his existence purged until he has almost become a myth in the st century these massive purges have happened many times before in many areas of this planet there were maos purges stalins purges then even back to the egyptians the purge of hatshepsut archaeological findings by accident her purge was so complete i still dont know the exact reason why but it has to do with the start of the cold war and eisenhower studying the eisenhower society its only in retrospect how much the baby boomers were propagandized and polarized in god we trust added to the currency one nation under god added to the pledge being required to say the pledge every morning through elementary school it might be because tesla was writing world leaders before the war trying to prevent it he was invited to russia and built something for them tesla also had many friends in croatia that would visit him and he would keep in touch with it appears tesla was viewed as a communist or communist supporter and that is why tesla was wiped from us history it also helps that nobody would question what really was in that safe when they didnt even know about any safe look at what is going on with the fbi now and if you file a foia for teslas safe contents the reply will be the fbi didnt find anything in the safe except it was empty and documents from to are so black marker redacted that you can only read a word or two per page nobody else finds this sinister
