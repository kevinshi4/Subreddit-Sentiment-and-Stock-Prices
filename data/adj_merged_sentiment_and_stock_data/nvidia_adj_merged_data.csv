forum for feedback link here submit driver feedback directly to nvidia link here rodrogs driver benchmark tbd rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer program with free sdks stateoftheart deep learning courses certification and access to expert help sound interesting learn more

driver release notes nvidia driver forum for feedback link here submit driver feedback directly to nvidia link here rodrogs driver benchmark tbd rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer program with free sdks stateoftheart deep learning courses certification and access to expert help sound interesting learn more

feedback link here submit driver feedback directly to nvidia link here rodrogs driver benchmark tbd rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open

midproduction to v and thus new s are secretly losing up to mhz hi everyone i do a bunch of overclocking research and reverse engineer nvidias stuff for funsies you may have heard of my recent nvflash bypass that allows flashing any bios called nvflashk while toying around with my fresh strix and trying to publicly document and chart the relationship between voltages and max clock speed i realized that what i was seeing ghz at mv running k benchmarks should be impossible i also noticed the effective clocks in hwinfo were linearly changing with the commands from my evc i had always passed off that hwinfo sensor as some silly estimate but hwinfo shouldnt be aware of what voltage my evc is sending to the vrm controller over my soldered on wires the true voltage is not seen anywhere in the os and the driver is not aware of it either as all the voltagerelated things in the driverbios such as downbinning without a in afterburner do not respond to my changes additionally the effective clock speed changes resulting from the hacked voltage tracked very closely with the changes to my benchmark scoresframerates despite my target clock remaining mhz in evga precision all this combined means that the effective clock sensor in hwinfo must be accurate so i began mapping it out in relation to voltage and found even more surprising things heres the spreadsheet to my findings on exactly how much nvidia is clock stretching our s the results are surprising up to at mv but also at mv that means newly produced s are silently losing up to mhz despite being advertised as running just as good as any other because they arent allowed to go beyond mv that means the revision wasnt just a simple voltage reduction nvidia flat out reduced the max performance of the midproduction and theres no way for a buyer to know without checking the bios version and for those that are undervolting that claim theyre running ghz stable at mv unfortunately youre probably actually losing of the speed you think you have you can check yourself simply by using the hwinfo effective clock sensor those that are closer to stock and arent overclocking with afterburner will have much smaller differences than those who turn up their cards naturally but there will likely still be a reduction however small it will only be truly locked at mv i also made a video on this documenting this phenomenon further but the mods deleted that post understandably as its youtube promotion so youll have to find it on your own on my profile if you want to see the testing or super in depth weird details its nearly minutes long so way too long for a reddit post edit apparently galax hof cards dont experience this that may be part of what makes them a little extra special key takeaways if you undervolt and still somehow achieve high clocks you are not actually running at that speed at mv i saw clock stretching of that magically allowed me to run ghz if you have a that only goes up to mv when maxing the slider out in afterburnerprecision you are being held back by up to mhz until you flash a v bios if you have a launch or flashed to v and youre overclocking youre still possibly being held back by a couple bins unless you overvolt to mv if youre happy with performance and dont care about true clock speeds this means nothing to you but if youve ever said well shit my card can do this same thing at less voltage youre probably being misled by the nvidia drivers if you paid for a fancy oc version of your card but its a v and you actually overclock it youve basically thrown money away compared to those who bought the early s and you will get close to the same performance once you use afterburner unless you flash your bios with nvflashk this behavior is most likely not limited to s but thats all i have to test with right this moment what if i dont overclock at all a lot of people made a good point i tested max clocks pushed to the limit in precision what about stock settings for someone who never even downloads afterburner or precision under load the gpu will automatically clock up based on the available voltage given to it youll see a mhz at completely stock settings go to mhz under load however the effective clock will only go to mhz secretly unless you increase the voltage with the slider or even better an evc you usually do not run the rated boost clock when under load so you still get the clock speeds you see on the box and then some when running completely default settings if youve never changed your clock speed none of this affects you but if you use afterburner or precision whatsoever youre probably secretly being held back by voltage and thinking youre achieving overclocks that you actually arent,0.9917501899180934,0.0,-0.2457194924354553,0.9943,0.5941789243406674,0.0,-0.4607169129885733,0.971225

release notes nvidia driver forum for feedback link here submit driver feedback directly to nvidia link here rodrogs driver benchmark tbd rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer program with free sdks stateoftheart deep learning courses certification and access to expert help sound interesting learn more

not to have to come here to complain but given what you can read in the title i feel like i have no choice now timeline below wednesday october found out the vhpwr connector had melted a bit on my card after unplugging it while doing some routine cleaning of my case not a super bad melt but a melt nonetheless got in touch with nvidia customer support who was still pretty responsive and quick at this point and got me an rma label by friday night which i then used to have everything shipped out by sunday thursday october gpu is delivered to nvidia and in the evening of the following monday october i get a shipment notification for a replacement unit so far so good i think to myself in terms of timing even if the nightmare has really yet to begin that shipment notification indicates the units part number ends with rf instead of which indicates this is a refurbished unit wednesday november the refurbished replacement unit arrives despite being skeptical of receiving a refurbished unit obviously i have to give it a chance but for my own protection i make a video recording of me unboxing it and lo and behold this thing is in sht condition for reference the following damages were present io plate is bentwarped in multiple directions and as my case is already a tight fit im confident this wouldnt even have fit sure you could argue that i couldve taken some pliers and straightened it out but forgive me if im wrong but i spent over k cad on this card call me a princess or diva or whatever you want but i paid too damn much for this to jankily be modifying it just to be able to fit in my case and risking further damage sense pins in vhpwr connector were also bentmisaligned this issue may have even been more serious as it was contact issues in the vhpwr connector that were believed to have caused the melting issues in the first place this issue alone was enough for me not to feel comfortable plugging this into a power source whatsoever even if it did fit notwithstanding the bent io plate as mentioned above seriously wobblymisaligned exhaust fan while i understand this doesnt necessarily imply a brokennonfunctioning fan per se my experience with wobbly fans is they usually tend to become audibly rumbly or even entirely dislodged over time usually the span of a few years and im not about to take a chance on this becoming a reality after my warranty is up years down the line general cosmetic neglect and filth as observed through scratchesscuffs all around the unit obviously this is much more noticeable with matte black surfaces like those on the backplates of the fe cards but still bent radiator fins and flakes of human skin and hair lodged in the various crevices throughout ugh i get that cosmetic imperfections are somewhat to be expected with refurbished aka used units but when i pay k for something i feel like i cant be alone in saying i take impeccable care of it and expect anyone else handling it on my behalf to do the same in any case if the unit i sent in is in such a condition i expect to receive back something in as good of a condition especially when ive only had the gpu since february in any case i reopened another rma request with reasoning and pictures to the effects described above saturday november my request for a second rma is approved and i ship it out that weekend thursday november the refurbished unit arrives back at nvidia for reference all shipping was done with the prepaid fedex labels provided by nvidia and the waiting game begins monday november after calling several times just to hear the same bs answer of keep waiting over and over again a level support member by the name of jason is assigned to the case and informs via email me that a technical issue prevented my rma from being processed up until the week prior but that it had now been resolved and that a replacement unit has been requested from the warehouse okay only a matter of days now i think to myself but given that i am here posting on this subreddit today its obvious that i was sorely mistaken monday november i follow up by email to jason again the prior night asking for an update given im at the point where i havent had a discrete gpu in my pc since midoctober i sht you not his verbatim response was your query was raised with the warehouse last week and again today i have not heard back yet but will update when i have news to share guys im at my limit here while i can appreciate that the normally within business days upon receiving your return timeline for sending back a replacement may not always be possible to make good on lmfao clearly seeing as we are on business day since november now it is this lack of transparency and expectation of me to keep waiting indefinitely without any sort of clarity on a timeline around when i can get a real fking answer from nvidia as to when i can roughly expect to get back one of the single most expensive things i have ever bought that is absolutely not cool i have also told them that even if the answer they have for me is not the answer i want to hear such as they have no inventory of s to send i would rather know of this rather than keep being kept in the dark with nothing more than a weekly keep waiting update for all eternity its clear that nvidias consumer products division is very siloed given all the departments of level support level support and the rma team warehouse seem to be connected by nothing more than the occasional email between one another and while im not one to pretend i know of a better way to run a nowtrillion dollar market cap company i am going to say that this is making for a reprehensible customer experience im at the point where im probably on a first name basis with all the level supports that answer customer phone calls and its not fair to them to constantly have to deal with me when they really cant do anything but tell me reply to the email chain with the assigned level support member on it jason who henceforth doesnt seem to be able to do anything but ping the warehouse occasionally for an update though him maybe trying to get more directly in touch with the warehouse such as over the phone would honestly be appreciated if he has that ability that is and also just tell me to keep waiting thus im hoping that one of the nvidia subreddit mods can read this to please provide me some clarity on why the holdup and if there really is an issue of inventory shortage for example to find a way to work with me such as a refund or a definitive date of the next restocked batch coming in from which i can get a unit for reference my incident number with customer support is while my case number and rma number as they relate to rma case itself are and respectively xb update wednesday

geforce rtx super founders edition below is the compilation of all the reviews that have been posted so far i will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links this will be sorted alphabetically written articles babeltechreviews the nvidia rtx super is a strong contender in the p gaming market offering substantial improvements over its predecessor and rival amd cards at the same price point while it excels in p performance it is also a viable option for k gaming with some settings adjustments owners of the should keep their cards and we only recommend class series upgrades if you really want the latest and greatest and play games that can take advantage of dlss there is not such a large raw performance upgrade that we can say every user should upgrade but the ai capabilities and class series of upgrades from nvidia could sway you to upgrade cgdirector the rtx super graphics card is nearly an rtx ti without getting all the way there for video editing and motion graphicsanimation workloads im reasonably confident that this card at its msrp will be the best bangforbuck option on shelves for this generation of gpus on the other hand if you need a new gpu for your gpu rendering setup id wait for all the new super graphics cards to launch before pulling the trigger on this one keep your eyes peeled for more slot solutions further up the series line a slot rtx ti super thats nearly an rtx would be a truly super gpu for rendering if youve been holding out for a genuinely significant upgrade over something like an rtx or a the rtx super is an excellent option not only does it finally beat the topend card from nvidias lastgen rtx series but it does so at a somewhat reasonable price that said you should know that nvidias rtx series or whatever theyll call it is slated to launch in a year so if youre happy with the performance youre getting right now you could stick with it for another year however if your work demands faster hardware especially for the workloads we covered above now is as good a time as any for an upgrade dexterto the rtx impressed us upon its release by essentially being a parallel to an rtx with more vram and handy frame generation features however the gpus only foil was that the card didnt match up to performance expectations when it came to generational uplift if you cast your mind back to the rtx series the original matched up to the performance of a ti now the rtx super looks to absolve nvidia of this issue entirely by offering up rtx level performance at an accessible price while our only criticism of the vram capacity remains the rtx super is everything the original card should have been at launch its easy to rake nvidia over the coals when a gpu releases and its not quite as good as everyone expects but you have to equally give team green some credit here the super simply trounces the current competition from the rx xt by offering faster performance allround and dlss s framegeneration features as well as better ray traced performance for a slight premium i get a lot of questions about which gpu people should buy and its always been quite difficult to answer but nvidia has handed the answer to me on a silver platter this is the goto gpu for people looking for the ideal pricetoperformance ratio on the market as it stands you also get heaps of extra nvidia ai software features in broadcast reflex and more no matter if youre looking for a card that can manage adequate k great p or blazing p framerates the rtx super has it all at this midtohighend price point this gpu is simply unbeatable i just wished that it had come out earlier digital foundry article digital foundry video tbd there are many different ways of looking at the rtx supers delivery of price vs performance especially with rt factored into the equation youre looking at a decent performance boosts over the standard rtx which now looks excessively priced at its new pricepoint meanwhile in a world where the rtx ti cost at launch youre usually getting to percent of its performance level with a substantial price cut thats not bad however threeandahalf years from its launch the rtx continues to remind us that value just isnt the same as it was yes the rtx super is cheaper more efficient and has more memory but ultimately the performance increase is variable at worst its like a slightly faster rtx at best its up there with rtx and thats before we factor in dlss frame generation which is a very useful feature on a broader level performance thats in line with rtx ti or rtx isnt bad at all for the pricepoint but amds radeon rx xt continues to be an interesting competitor if you can get it at its msrp it lacks the hardware features that make nvidia so compelling while its rt performance is way behind even so it continues to deliver the goods in terms of rasterisation and the gb complement of framebuffer memory remains a spec point where you cant help but feel nvidia should be doing better so the first super arrival increases value and like the series refresh comes across as the kind of pricing we should have had at launch in terms of competition amds radeon rx xt continues to possess more memory holds up well in rasterisation and obviously costs a lot less to the point where cutting prices on the nonsuper to match it would have been a good idea however in terms of features and overall performance the super is the one to have eteknix would i replace my xxx series card with a super not likely its a small upgrade offering something like fps in a lot of games but there are other improvements to the cooling and efficiency that are welcome too however if you want a more compelling reason to upgrade from the xxx or xxx series of cards or exponentially more so even older cards then this certainly tips the scale in the favour of consumers the card is on average around faster than the rtx and on par with the ti but with a significantly lower cost per frame between the amd xt and the nvidia rtx super its an extremely close race on average with amd coming in around cheaper thats maybe a nobrainer for some but i still think nvidia lead the pack with their scaling frame generation and ray tracing technologies and for some thats worth paying the extra premium gurud the geforce rtx super gb has been released at a retail price of making it a more budgetfriendly option for highend gaming compared to the earlier rtx ti which was priced at this graphics card is designed with features like ray tracing dlss and aipowered assists targeting gamers looking for optimal performance it comes equipped with an increased count of shader cores up from gb of gbps gddrx memory on a bit memory interface and a maximum bandwidth of gbs additionally the rtx super includes rt cores tensor cores tmus and rops it utilizes the same billion transistor counting ad silicon as the rtx ti with out of streaming multiprocessors activated this makes the rtx super a compelling more accessible option for those seeking highend gaming performance boasting a powerful architecture advanced ray tracing capabilities and enhanced dlss technology the geforce rtx super showcases significant improvements in performance compared to it predecessor compared to the radeon series the rtx s ray tracing performance has a bit more stamina making notable advancements in this field additionally with the dlss frame generation technology the gpu can create remarkable visual experiences in games that support it the rtx super is a graphics card that can create waves in the gaming world due to its rendering quality and gaming performance when combined with dlss frame generation the rtx provides a bit more value for the money it is a wellbalanced card that can handle gaming at wqhd and even k resolution although it is targeted towards wqhd compared to amds offerings the nvidia gpu struggles to keep up with the radeon rx xt but has positive aspects like dlss and ray tracing features which work exceptionally well amd cannot match nvidia in this regard the rtx super is an excellent option for gamers who play at uwhd qhd and even uhd monitor resolutions the geforce rtx founder edition graphics card stands out with its very nice performance and visual quality thanks to dls and rt assistance it is also characterized by enhanced power efficiency and lower thermal output positioning it as an excellent energyefficient choice this card is suited for highresolution gaming and demanding creative tasks with its gb of vram being quite satisfactory for most applications in the competitive landscape particularly when comparing it to the radeon rx xt specific capabilities such as ray tracing and dlss areas is where the rtx super shows notable strength conversely the radeon rx xt boasts a faster rasterizer engine and additional l cache presenting it as a formidable alternative however with the rtx priced lower it may offer better value for some users the rtx super seems to align more closely in competition with the radeon xt xt rather than the xt its performance can be likened to that of the rtx series varying according to the benchmarks used aesthetically the founder edition models of the rtx super are visually striking and add to its appeal with the new more dark design the card is capable of handling ultra hd gaming particularly when utilizing features like dlss and frame generation and even supports mild overclocking the geforce rtx founder edition is a respectable option for those seeking performing and a visually appealing graphics card pricing remains a point of friction in the market hot hardware after months of rumors and leaks and nvidias official announcement at ces a couple of weeks back the geforce rtx super was somewhat of a known quantity heading into todays launch we are however impressed overall and think nvidia is going to shake things up with the introduction of its geforce rtx series super gpus the geforce rtx super will be hitting store shelves shortly after you read this with founders edition and similarly configured partner boards commanding an msrp of thats slightly higher than the geforce rtx s introductory price but nearly below the geforce rtx ti radeon rx xt cards are currently for sale in the and radeon rx xt starts around with some models breaking the mark looking back through the numbers the geforce rtx super puts a hurting on the radeon rx xt and often hangs with the radeon rx xt particularly when ray tracing is in the mix at the geforce rtx super is a very solid value in its price segment and puts significant pressure on amd we suspect amd and its partners will have to react somehow especially in terms of radeon rx xt pricing while we tried to show an array of compute rendering encoding graphics and gaming workloads in our testing nvidia offers a ton of additional functionality with the geforce rtx series that must be considered as well from rtx video super resolution to av encoding to aiaccelerated tools for various content creation applications nvidia broadcast and others geforce rtx series cards arent just for gaming the combination of nvidias extensive software support with the geforce rtx supers relatively strong performance and competitive pricing make it a compelling option in its product segment if youre looking for a gpu in this price range the geforce rtx super should be at the top of your short list igors lab the geforce rtx super with the ad is a highly interesting midrange card that no longer has to fear a direct competitor from amd in this super generation until team red brings a slimmeddown and attractively priced rx nonxt to the german market or pumps the rx gre into the normal channel and not just supplies system integrators in terms of efficiency nvidia is once again setting standards by which amd must but currently cannot be measured whether and when the rx without xt or a gre for everyone will come is still written in the stars but gamers live in the here and now and there are simply no alternatives at the moment if you want the complete feature set including highquality super sampling frame generation and ai apart from the outdated display port connection and the still somewhat meagre gb memory expansion for ultra hd i dont see any disadvantages with the geforce rtx super that would speak against this card the price is okay so far if you put it in relation to the performance of the other cards because amd isnt really any cheaper the manufacturers will hardly make any big profits with the msrp cards at least that much i can tell you but they wont starve either much of it is little more than a zerosum game where it only becomes somewhat profitable through the masses kitguru article kitguru video in terms of its gaming performance the super slots between the rtx and the rtx ti though it comes in much closer to the latter than it does the former at p for instance its faster on average than the vanilla but just slower than the ti variant that performance bump is enough to make it faster than the rx xt this time by an margin while it offers more performance than the lastgen rtx gb k gaming isnt out of the question especially if you enable dlss though the super does fare better at p due to its relatively narrow bit memory interface which isnt suited for higher resolutions ray tracing performance also scales similarly at least when comparing the super to the og and the ti it is significantly faster than the rx xt over the eight games we tested with ray tracing enabled to the tune of on average while its in the same class as the rx xtx we already knew nvidia has the edge when it comes to ray tracing performance and that is further confirmed by our testing today interestingly despite performance increasing by about over the original rtx power draw is only higher on average with this new super card and that means it is a touch more efficient than the other xx skus it cant quite match the rtx in terms of performance per watt that remains the most efficient ada gpu weve tested so far but it only widens the gap between the rx xt and its competition whats clear is that if you are in the market for a new gpu things just got that bit better sure the rtx super may not be a revolution in graphics performance but its hard to quibble with an extra performance and increased efficiency all at the same price as the previous product its also fair to point out that the rx xt remains a viable option for those only interested in bang per buck with the rdna gpu still offering the best cost per frame for rasterised p gaming and of course it does offer that extra gb vram many may now be swayed by the super however considering it is faster outright significantly so when it comes to ray tracing performance while also offering support for its superior dlss upscaling technology alongside increased efficiency whatever your priorities theres no doubt the nvidia rtx super is a step in the right direction lets hope this is a sign of things to come lanoc as far as performance goes the new rtx super takes a nice step forward ahead of the original rtx by increasing the core count this translated to a improvement at p in our testing and at k with p and p running into some cpu limited situations with just a watt increase in power usage this also moved the nvidia rtx super founders edition up higher in our performance to wattage charts as well gaming performance was especially effective once i got into rtx and dlss testing which with dlss and dlss combined with frame generation you can see huge performance improvements even in situations where your game is cpu limited the nvidia rtx super founders edition even did well in raster performance compared with amds current generation rx xt but i will talk about that here in a second when we get into pricing the founders edition cooler still kept things running relatively cool even with a little higher tgp and the under load noise performance had the card running surprisingly quiet so nvidia has the nvidia rtx super founders edition starting at an msrp of this is the same price as the original rtx when it launched back in april of for an idea of where that puts it in the market the rx xt from amd can be found in the to range the rtx is now and the rtx ti is in the range there are also a few rx xt options still available as well at the rtx super does outperform the rx xt and the rx xt but you are going to pay more to get that performance adding ray tracing and dlss performance into the mix helps add value as well which as long as the games that you plan on playing support it there is a lot of value to be had ocd article ocd video tbd however the fact remains that the rtx is still a brilliant card its still a fabulous gaming card in all but the most demanding k games if youre on anything from the range or earlier or all but the flagship radeon card this will spank any game you offer up to it additionally the cuda and tensor cores leverage massive rendering potential in either d video encoding or even ai generation tasks it might leave a nasty taste in our mouth but its still incredibly nourishing yes if budgets are tight you should use the introduction of the super and subsequent price drop of the vanilla card to get one of them if you want performance the soontobe ended ti card is still the best bet before you reach the rtx but the rtx super fe is on the shelves and reasonably priced with great performance thus winning our ocd gamers choice award pc perspective while an improvement over the original and generally more so than in this comparison with an overclocked rtx the new geforce rtx super does not always reach the heights that a cuda core increase vs might suggest the card is powered by the same ad gpu albeit a more enabled one but is limited to the bit memory system of the original rtx with gbps memory this means we have the same bandwidth but the new card does have mb of l cache up from mb with the original i still have to wonder how much better this card could have performed with some faster memory and a boost clock bump and if there is some actual overclocking headroom ill be happy to follow up with more testing as it is the geforce rtx super does represent a better value than the original at the same usd price point but the upcoming rtx ti super promises to be a far more interesting entry into the lineup pc world tbd techgage tbd techpowerup averaged over the games in our test suite at p we find the rtx super founders edition faster than the rtx nonsuper which is a pretty substantial improvement for a refreshunlike what intel did with their th gen raptor lake this means that the card is able to match last generations rtx flagship and the gap to rtx ti shrinks to just rtx ti benefits from its higher power limit of w though while amds radeon rx xt was a bit faster than rtx in pure raster scenarios this has changed with the rtx super which is now fasteran important goal that nvidia achieved successfully the gap to rtx is still pretty big with likely the reason why nvidia is launching the rtx ti super and rtx super to cover strategically important points in that segment with these performance numbers rtx super is a perfect match for p with maximum settings you should be able to enable ray tracing in most titles too thanks to modern upscalers even k at solid framerates is in reach with the card just like the other geforce cards rtx super has support for all of nvidias dlss technologies nvidia dlss upscaling dlss frame generation and dlss ray reconstruction on top of that you can enable amd fsr and fsr in games because those technologies work on all gpus from all vendors basically this means that youll be covered in terms of upscaling and frame generation while dlss is definitely the leading solution right now with best game support amd is pushing hard and their frame generation solution will come to several major titles in from a technology perspective dlss is superior because it uses the optical flow hardware unit in ada gpus and nvidia reflex will help bring down the input latency priced at for the rtx super founders edition nvidias new card sells at the same price point as the msrp of rtx nonsuper the nonsuper is getting an official pricecut now but it has been at around months already which means the price cut is just making things official the cheapest rtx nonsuper is currently i suspect that in the coming weeks and months it will drop much closer to it has to because amds rx xt is offering a strong alternative to both the rtx and rtx s especially when you dont care about ray tracing even when considering nonsuper vs super i feel that a lot of people will be tempted to go to for the s or for a performance increase isnt such a bad deal especially in this segment for amd vs nvidia the situation is similar dlss is the green teams biggest selling point super adds more performance on top of that at close enough pricing which aligns with nvidias pricing strategy betting that this is something many people desire still the current gpu market as a whole is far from affordable or tempting it seems that amd is happy with the current situation in which they follow nvidias pricing undercutting them only slightlyno price war in sight given rtx supers positioning and performance and the lower price of rtx nonsuper i suspect that amd will adjust their pricing for rx xt a bit what could really make a difference if they gave rx xt a substantial pricecut but that seems unlikely considering that they never tried to make the card sexy from a pricing perspective and rather opted for close enough to xtx so that people will consider the upsell option for rtx super that means it owns that price point theres no way people will buy a rx xt rx xt or rtx instead of super unless they seriously go down in pricing i guess some dlss naysayers could be tempted by a used sub rtx gb but besides that the only real competition is the rx xt and nvidias own geforce cards the fps review with the launch of the geforce rtx series super gpus you are going to hear a lot of this is what it should have been from the beginning while that can be said it is more nuanced and layered than this nvidia has addressed its segmentation and pricing and is now offering a better priceperformance offering and overall creating a more desirable lineup for its gpus it is certainly a value increase at these price points in our testing the geforce rtx super is a bigger performance uplift from the geforce rtx than rumors were suggesting we are seeing it make a pretty significant difference in performance compared to the geforce rtx the fact that nvidia is giving you more performance at the same price point is positive and a good move it creates a performance and pricing value increase in this price segment from the rtx series lineup overall the geforce rtx super is a better value than the geforce rtx was at there is a decent performance difference between the geforce rtx and geforce rtx super to warrant the differences in pricing now and make it more appealing at there are a lot of nvidia rtx features packed in here which can make the price premium worth it the features are compelling there is stiff competition from the competition in this generation so be sure to check pricing to get the best deals tomshardware if youre in the market for a new graphics card that costs around give or take the rtx super now looks like the best option its not perfect but its a nice step up from the existing its efficient and it provides all of the usual nvidia features but we also said most of these things about the rtx when it first launched and if you werent enticed to upgrade then the super doesnt massively change the underlying prospects given the choice wed take the super at over the rx xt at even though it doesnt have as much memory and all indications are that amd has no intention of launching anything new that will compete with the super the rx xt and xt have already launched while the upcoming rx xt targets the rtx for the highend gaming market the super is arguably the best option right now lets just hope the

geforce rtx ti super below is the compilation of all the reviews that have been posted so far i will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links this will be sorted alphabetically psa certain msi geforce rtx ti super ventus x vbios causes lower performance than expected written articles babeltechreviews nvidia claimed a increase of the previous model and we did achieve mostly that in our testing with some slightly lower than quoted its obvious this card easily surpasses the original model at the same price and its really close to the original rtx performance point at significantly less than msrp for the rtx this will change soon with the upcoming launch of the rtx super at its lowered price point of the real decision for gamers in our opinion looking for a card at this level is looking for a used rtx or something at this similar price if you are looking for a new card that can compete with the rtx for lower entry cost then this is a good choice digital foundry article tbd digital foundry video tbd eteknix so im going to admit that was painful when looking at performance and analysing the point of our content its easy to get excited when we see an evolutionary jump but thats not the case here its slightly faster and im talking marginally when you look at the specifications this new graphics card is better in every way there are higher core counts there are more rt and tensor cores theres more vram the clock speeds are up and really that should be an indication of a pretty potent performance boost however from our pretty extensive testing thats not really what we see in the real world its a little bit better but does it feel like an upgrade not really if im being honest more vram is nice and does improve the lows but not as much as the fanatics in the internet comment sections would have you believe it would have dlss and other technologies should have seen a boost too but in games like cyberpunk and hogwarts legacy some were up some were down and some were about the same so it is splitting hairs on whether this is better or not not that theres anything wrong with the performance though its still largely a very great card the performance is fantastic but it just feels like something may be missing i hope and honestly largely expect that this will improve with a few driver updates as things always do i suspect in a few weeks or a couple of months the super variants will have a bigger lead on the nonsuper cards they are replacing what i do like about both the gigabyte and innod cards is the cooler upgrades gigabyte has honed its windforce designs over the years and innod has a greatlooking product too with a slot form factor having a premium quality cooler on this chipset showed that it can run nice and cool and quiet while still delivering great performance overall so overall the ti super can be taken one of two ways if youre already rocking a ti then there is no reason to change to a ti super and if you want more performance then you need to be looking at levels or above but even then id personally wait for the super to see what that brings though i fear it could be the same levels as what we saw today if however youre on something older and your heart was set on a ti then obviously it makes sense to pay the same and get a ti super though id seriously be questioning how much extra performance youre going to be gaining over what you already have gurud the data speaks for itself key factors here are gaming performance and rendering quality indeed the rtx ti super offers better value for money compared to the this card is approaching the raw performance required for gaming at k resolution it caters specifically to enthusiast gamers who typically use monitors with uwhd qhd or uhd resolutions making it an ideal choice for that demographic the rasterizer engine in the rtx series significantly surpasses the performance capabilities of its predecessors this series introduces a new generation of more potent ray tracing and tensor cores raw counts of rt and tensor cores are not the sole indicators of performance rather the effectiveness of each unit is key these cores are positioned near the shader engine enhancing their efficiency a fact that is evident in their performance while tensor cores impact is more challenging to quantify the impressive results observed especially with dlss indicate their robust performance the geforce rtx ti demonstrates its strength across various resolutions performing effectively from k x to k x overall the geforce rtx ti super delivers a robust gaming experience and when comparing it directly to similar gpus it surpasses the performance range of the ti and is close to the rtx with some variability in a broader context when comparing it to other gpus like the radeon rx xt and xtxtx a complex decisionmaking process ensues the choice between the ti super and xtx hinges on several factors the rtx ti super excels in ray tracing performance and boasts the added benefit of dlss and at many levels is on par with more than cards looking at team red the xt exhibits a slight advantage in rasterizer engine performance supported by its additional l cache the gb of vram offered by the ti super is sufficient for most current titles especially when playing at ultra hd resolutions powered by the ada gpu architecture this card delivers precision and competence in gaming the substantial increase in shader cores translates to nearly times the raw shader performance resulting in faster ray tracing and improved tensor core performance underlying technologies such as shader execution reordering ser and dlss contribute to the excellence of the new product and the series overall in conclusion the geforce rtx ti super leaves a notable impression and is sure to please gamers but it comes at a considerable cost despite its commendable performanceperwatt ratio its energy consumption levels remain relatively high this graphics card is capable of handling ultra hd gaming smoothly particularly when enhanced with dlss frame generation and offers the possibility of a moderate overclock the tuf gaming version of the geforce rtx ti super offers an appealing choice for users who value a quiet performance and visual appeal in their pc gaming setup the model we tested today which is the nonoverclocked nonoc version is priced at the manufacturers suggested retail price msrp of for retail purchase hot hardware at this point nvidias blueprint with the geforce rtx super series is clear boost performance at similar or lower introductory prices to enhance the overall value of the lineup the asus tuf geforce rtx ti super arrives at the same price point of its predecessor but offers more cores more video memory and ultimately more performance across every workload the asus tuf geforce rtx ti super cant quite catch the geforce rtx bit it comes close in many tests for a couple of hundred bucks less with recent price cuts the radeon rx x is being offered for about looking back through the numbers that price adjustment is just about inline with its performance relative to the asus tuf geforce rtx ti super if you factor in ray tracing in games that dont make extensive use of ray tracing and mostly rely on traditional rasterization techniques the radeon rx xt may pull ahead of the rtx ti super todays gpus are about much more than gaming however looking at the content creation rendering and other compute tests and the asus tuf geforce rtx ti super outpaces the radeons ultimately the geforce rtx ti super represents additional value for gamers and creators it arrives at the same price point as its predecessor but effectively offers more of everything if youve got the budget and are looking for a gpu its price category the geforce rtx ti super is the card to beat right now and asus tuf model ticks many of the right boxes igors lab the geforce rtx ti super is an excellent card in wqhd when it comes to the highest frame rates and is also quite suitable for ultra hd at the latest then however you will have to think about smart upscaling in places and this is where dlss and frame generation come into play meanwhile games such as the last of us part tlou look subjectively even better in ultra hd with dlss than native ultra hd this is where nvidia can really play to its advantages which dlss x and above all dlss also offer in purely visual terms however if a game also supports frame generation and you would still be bobbing around in the less playable fps range even with super sampling then this can even be a lifeline to good playability you cant improve the latency with it but not every genre is as latencybound as various shooters i would have really liked dlss for tlou but you cant have everything from this point of view the geforce rtx ti super completely fulfills all expectations based on the data already published all the ai including the appropriate programs dlss frame generation and the often better latencies are also good arguments if it werent for the current dumping by amd which should be just right for the customer the geforce rtx ti super with the ada is a thoroughly interesting upper midrange card but nothing more at the moment especially in view of the amd radeon rx xt and the current price difference it wont sell for the really good features but rather only for the street price apart from the outdated display port connection i dont see any disadvantages at all with the geforce rtx ti super that would speak against this card only the price has just been badly undermined by the competitor we will have to wait and see whether the socalled oc cards justify the additional price after all msi has shown with the ventus x that even the msrp card can almost perfectly convert the additional performance of the significantly increased number of shaders into adequate gaming performance kitguru article kitguru video ultimately the rtx ti super is about as good as i was expecting considering the bump in core count and the switch to gigs of memory over a bit interface i will certainly be interested to see how other models compare as if the ventus x really is slower than what the ti super should be then thats only a further positive for the new gpu as a whole of course i can only base my conclusions on what we have tested but even then this is a strong refresh and a gpu thats well worth buying i do believe the rx xt remains a credible option if rasterised gaming is your top priority as it is still slightly faster overall while some strategically timed cutprice deals only increase the value proposition that said i think if you are spending on a new graphics card chances are you will be tempted by the superior ray tracing performance dlss support and increased efficiency of the rtx ti super lanoc as for its performance the rtx ti super has more cuda cores and nvidia has also increased the video memory up from gb to gb which should help at high resolutions and help keep the card relevant in the future for longer in my testing this translated to a increase in performance depending on the testing in game at p it was faster than the overclocked tuf gaming rtx ti that i tested previously but at k this ramped up to and i saw similar numbers in synthetic benchmarks like time spy and time spy extreme which it improved on time spy and on time spy extreme this helped it catch up with amds rx xt especially at k but the xt was on average still fps faster at p where the xt didnt keep up was with ray tracing performance and once you figure in dlss which the games you are playing support it is a huge improvement the performance improvement also helped with overall efficiency while it has the same tgp our tuf gaming rtx ti super did pull a hair more than our overclocked tuf gaming rtx ti did for power but with the performance improvement its already great power to performance was even better the cooler for the tuf gaming rtx ti super ran surprisingly quiet in my testing as well and while i wouldnt say the cooling performance was the best it did perform well keeping the card more than cool enough which when combined with how quiet it was would make me happy as for pricing the tuf gaming rtx ti super is launching at the rtx ti super launch msrp of this fits right in at the same msrp as last years rtx ti which is it replacing there arent any game partnerships right now however which is a bummer given that amds rx xt does come with avatars frontiers or pandora amd did also just recently dropped the pricing on a few of their cards including the xt which now has an msrp of in response to nvidias super cards announcement this does put the xt as the better value if you are looking only at raster performance but i do think that the ray tracing and dlss performance have a lot of value as well and that difference still makes this a good pickup if you are looking for highend performance without spending rtx or rx xtx numbers the tuf gaming rtx ti super specifically is looking especially appealing this time around given that there isnt a founders edition for this gpu and its allmetal construction asus does have an overclocked model as well which will hit stores at and a white overclocked tuf model for they will also have a pro art card for that same price point and then a strix model as well which has a hefty price point which is way too close to the announced msrp of the rtx super in my opinion ocd article tbd ocd video tbd pc perspective this was a refreshing review not just because the rtx ti has been refreshed and is now super for the same price but because it really lives up to the super branding with doubledigit gains over its predecessor this card is being neatly dropped in to the same price slot as its predecessor bringing quite a bit of rtx dna along with it you know its like nvidia was holding out on us they could have released the rtx ti in this ad configuration with this level of performance all along if they really wanted to it would have made the original price tag a lot more palatable or maybe they were playing chess and now that weve accepted this price level theyre bringing performance in line with expectations i think im babbling at this point bottom line the new geforce rtx ti super isnt just the first card in nvidias history to be both a ti and a super at the same time its a solid performer with a significantly better priceperformance ratio than its predecessor we cant argue with that and once you factor in ray tracing performance dlss and frame generation if youre into that sort of thing at this is a lot of gpu in the current market pc world tbd techgage tbd techpowerup with these performance numbers rtx ti super is a perfect match for p with maximum settings its actually slightly overkill which means that the card is a decent option for k monitors too or for p at hz while you wont be able to game at k at highest settings just dropping them down a bit should help get those frames and theres always the various upscaling technologies especially if you plan on enabling ray tracing just like the other geforce cards rtx ti super has support for all of nvidias dlss technologies nvidia dlss upscaling dlss frame generation and dlss ray reconstruction on top of that you can enable amd fsr and fsr in games because those technologies work on all gpus from all vendors basically this means that youll be covered in terms of upscaling and frame generation while dlss is definitely the leading solution right now with best game support amd is pushing hard and their frame generation solution will come to several major titles in from a technology perspective dlss is superior because it uses the optical flow hardware unit in ada gpus and nvidia reflex will help bring down the input latency the biggest selling point of the rtx ti super vs the rtx ti nonsuper is the increased vram size of gb rtx tis gb vram size has been a constant topic for debate on tech forums so it makes a lot of sense that nvidia is giving us a gb option now and at pretty reasonable pricing unlike rtx ti gb unlike more cores or higher clocks more vram will not make all games run faster automatically across all the game tests raster rt x resolutions we only identified two cases where gb results in a meaningful improvement over gb the last of us k and alan wake rt at k no doubt you will be able to find more such results with other titles too but the vast majority of games out there will not see any meaningful improvement from the gb upgrade im sure that this will change in the coming years with more and more games increasing their vram requirements but i dont think that a gb card will suddenly turn out to be useless in and you also have to consider that as soon as you enable upscaling the actual render resolution is reduced which lowers the vram usage significantly still given all the drama about gb vrampeople can finally put their money where their mouth is and grab the rtx ti super gb a secondary effect of the gb vram capacity is that the bus width is increased from bit to bit or this is required because to achieve gb you need to install eight gb memory chips each having a bit interface to the gpu with just gb and six chips a bit interface is sufficient x this increase in bus width leads to an equivalent increase in memory bandwidth which should help provide an additional performance boost looking at my data im not so convinced while the card does have slightly better scaling than rtx ti gb the rtx is still able to pull away at higher res it seems that what matters more for performance scaling is the l cache size and not the vram bus width unfortunately nvidia did limit the ti super to mb l cache while the rtx gets the full mb as expected ray tracing works very well on the geforce rtx ti super clearly offering a superior experience than what radeon rx xt and often even rx xtx can achieve on average the rtx ti super offers higher fps with rt than rx xt which is quite a bit nvidias new card also shows better rt performance numbers than rx xtx in most gamesif youre betting on ray tracing then definitely opt for the rtx ti super that doesnt mean that rt is unusable on amd its just running considerably slower because their cards are lacking dedicated hardware units to accelerate rt operations the fps review overall when it comes to rasterized gaming without ray tracing the new geforce rtx ti super is around faster than the geforce rtx ti this was the common number we experienced mostly without ray tracing when ray tracing was used this percentage number crept up slightly with ray tracing the geforce rtx ti super was more like faster with some outliers like alan wake there are of course games where the percentages were lower around or maybe even some under as you lower the resolution the highest differences were at k or with ray tracing looking at performance compared to the radeon rx xt is more mixed the radeon rx xt put up a competitive fight and in many games was as fast as the geforce rtx ti super or faster when looking at raster performance without ray tracing the radeon rx xt is compelling in its performance by comparison and this was at k and p more often than not there were standout games like starfield or cyberpunk or returnal or dying light where the radeon rx xt seemed to get the edge on the geforce rtx ti super even in alan wake performance was equal between the cards delivering the same experience the one sore spot for the radeon rx xt is once again ray tracing this is going to be game dependent and also depend on the types of ray tracing effects used and how heavily implemented they are the geforce rtx ti super has a huge lead in path tracing performance as is shown in alan wake and cyberpunk overall the geforce rtx ti super is going to deliver much higher ray tracing performance in games in some circumstances you can use upscaling fsr on the radeon rx xt to make it playable but this brings up the image quality of fsr at p that is an advantage the geforce rtx ti super has dlss and rtx features when the going gets tough on the geforce rtx ti super with ray tracing you can also use upscaling on it with dlss overall dlss has superior image quality to fsr at lower resolutions like p you will more likely want to use dlss on the geforce rtx ti super than you would want to use fsr on the radeon rx xt at p if you also want to get good ray tracing image quality the geforce rtx ti super also has dlss ray reconstruction support to improve ray tracing image quality in games that support it like alan wake and cyberpunk its ray tracing image quality is unmatched tomshardware this isnt a generously priced graphics card in other words and by raising the msrp nvidia probably took a more sizeable cut from its aib partners still its certainly better than paying the same for the rtx ti which is probably why the base price on those cards has fallen to around and weve seen sales push the price as low as which is still arguably too high is the rtx ti super worth the asking price that depends on what you want to do with it relative to amds rx xt even at its current promotional pricing starting at you can certainly make arguments in favor of nvidias gpu its more power efficient is potentially better equipped for future games if ray tracing adoption picks up offers access to nvidias proprietary dlss features including frame generation and you get superior ai performance if all you care about is rasterization performance amds xt comes out ahead and offers a better value and there are hundreds of new rasterizationonly games released every year but if you value any of those other extras even if you only think you might want to try them nvidia has cards at every price point that are worth a look ultimately the rtx ti super provides some worthwhile improvements over its nonsuper predecessor if youre in the market for a highend nvidia gpu and you havent upgraded in a few years its a great card just dont be surprised when nextgeneration gpus come out in a year or so that have even more new features improved performance and just maybe not a massive generational price increase we can dream
