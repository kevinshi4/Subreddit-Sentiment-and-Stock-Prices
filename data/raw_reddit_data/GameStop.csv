The walk from the lab to the GameStop was about 10 minute and I find the store is still closed so I just decided to wait, turned on my music and waited and waited and waited 

I checked my phone and saw it was 12:30 and was about to just leave when I saw an irate dude come barreling toward me asking me wat I was doing outside the store

I explained and he huffed and and began to open the door, he told me not to wait outside the store again cause it’s not fair to him to have to open up for one customer.

I’m very confused at this point cause like….y’all open at 12 and it’s half an hour past when you were supposed to open.

Any way I just go to look around and he seems to be following me and asking do I need help

I said no and continued looking around, at one point I saw a game and texted my roommate if it was the one she was looking for

The guy came up and accused me of shopping on Amazon in the store and said I was being very disrespectful, I tried to explain that I’m just checking with my roommate before buying a game

He said whatever then went back to the counter.

I found two games and went to the counter, he put on a whole act of surprise that I was ACTUALLY buying something, I asked to use my $5 credit and he got annoyed and took a long time to get everything going.

After my transaction he told me to leave I asked for my receipt and he got even more annoyed.

Not a giant end of the story, the mom ended up calling in to apologize and confirm that's what happened. I told her thanks for calling and that it was alright. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So last night I sold a brand new Dualsense 5 black controller to a really nice dude. We had a great convo, one of those transactions that makes your night a little better, yanno? He's not the kid in question...it's his cousin. 

So he got the controller for his cousin and he came back today, claiming that there was a white controller in the box. Woah! That's totally bonkers right?!? So myself and my SL look at it. I see the hand gunk in the crevices, he sees the dents. 

And as nicely as possible we are like ""yeah...this...wasn't a Sony mistake."" 

Now because of Sony's flimsy seals on their consoles, I ALWAYS check their seals on any product they put out. That ish was NEW. 

So while my SL is discussing LP stuff and how we can't *really* do anything, he mentions he got it for his cousin. I instantly ask ""how old is your cousin?"" 

10.

Surprise.....the 10 year old exists! </p>

<p>Not a giant end of the story, the mom ended up calling in to apologize and confirm that&#39;s what happened. I told her thanks for calling and that it was alright. </p>

<hr/>

<p>So last night I sold a brand new Dualsense 5 black controller to a really nice dude. We had a great convo, one of those transactions that makes your night a little better, yanno? He&#39;s not the kid in question...it&#39;s his cousin. </p>

<p>So he got the controller for his cousin and he came back today, claiming that there was a white controller in the box. Woah! That&#39;s totally bonkers right?!? So myself and my SL look at it. I see the hand gunk in the crevices, he sees the dents. </p>

<p>And as nicely as possible we are like &quot;yeah...this...wasn&#39;t a Sony mistake.&quot; </p>

<p>Now because of Sony&#39;s flimsy seals on their consoles, I ALWAYS check their seals on any product they put out. That ish was NEW. </p>

<p>So while my SL is discussing LP stuff and how we can&#39;t <em>really</em> do anything, he mentions he got it for his cousin. I instantly ask &quot;how old is your cousin?&quot; </p>

This was the first time I ever trusted GameStop with a collectors edition purchase and this is what happened. Absolutely disappointed.…. have a good day</p>

2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fc3425d1640>,,GameStop,"So yesterday was one of the scariest days of my life. To give a bit of backstory, there’s a guy who around a month ago came in. He never said a word and just stared at me from afar. But I could see an upside down cross tattoo on his forehead. That was the most notable part of his appearance. He had this sick grin on his face and while I was helping 2 girls get their cash for their system, he bolted up to us, cut the girls off, and got in my face. He was breathing really heavy and was shaking but never said a word. My assistant is a guy and he got in between us. He asked the man if he was okay, and the guy looked at him then left. The next day I was off and my assistant was working. The scary guy came back in again but this time with a ski mask on and asked for me directly. My ASM said I wasn’t in, and then called him out for being the guy from yesterday. The guy said “you know too much.” And left. I bought pepper spray and always watched my surroundings seeing as my store is in kind of a shady area. But yesterday was the cherry on top. I was training a new hire and was in to close with her. The night started fine as we were working on trades, she was learning to ring people out on her own, it was fun! But then when the store was empty, he walked in again. And as soon as we saw each other, he had that same sick grin. He never took his eyes off of me until he grabbed a pack of cards. He asked the new hire how much they were, and she said 6.99. When she rang them up, they came out to 7.25. He got mad and started speaking threateningly. Saying we need to learn a lesson about honesty. That if we aren’t careful someone could teach it to us. At this point I can’t breathe I’m so scared. I call one of my associates because I didn’t wanna anger him with me calling the cops. I know it might sound dumb but I was terrified. I had no idea what to do. I called him, he lives down the street and has 2 phones. He was at my other store. I knew he could call the cops without me looking suspicious to the guy. I kept my associate on the phone discussing things on main menu. Then the guy made his way over to me. He put another card pack in front of me and got close to my face. I started to ring him up and his total was $6.50. I told him and he chuckled and opened his pants waist to show me something. This wasn’t the first time he tried to make me look in his pants. I couldn’t really see nor did I want to. But he kept asking how much it was and was getting more and more angry when the price never changed. He reached in his pants and began shaking. Like he was getting nervous. My associate was about to call the police, and I think he could tell. He started to leave but my newhire said “wait don’t forget Your bag!” And he turned around, grabbed his bag of cards he had purchased and left on the counter (not the one I rang up) and then got in my face one last time and said “why didn’t you say anything? What are you trying to pull? Don’t tempt me.” And then left. As soon as he left I broke out sobbing. I locked the door, called the police, and pulled up DVR footage. They later found the guy and he admitted to having an obsession with me. He also said he was kicked out of his house for hostility due to him not taking his meds for his schizophrenia. My mom works in a law firm and has for my entire life. She’s seen this kind of behavior. It’s a fine line and I am terrified to work at that store alone. The cops said he’s banned, yea, but what will that really do to stop him? My associates and I think he’s trying to build up the courage to do something to me. So I’ve told my DM I cannot work at that store alone for the next few weeks. I’m too afraid. And she said she can’t accommodate that and this is part of the job sometimes. That I’ll be fine. She said the same thing the last time I begged to be able to call the police. When the guy came in with a ski mask on looking for me. I’m done I’m done with this company. I’m 22 years old and I have my entire life ahead of me. Someone from another store in my district reported that he had a gun pulled on him at my store before I became the SL to it.

My SGA & I opened today. We’re having a slow morning. A guest comes in and asks for a gift card, I ask for what? He said GameStop. I said okay, pick one of these from here. He chooses that and I ask how much on the card, he said in a tone give me one second, I patiently wait because we’re having a slow morning. He asks if I have bluey game preowned. I said unfortunately we do not, we are sold out completely. I ask him again, how much on the card. He says $50 so I load it with $50. I ask him is there anything else I could get for him today? He said no and gave me $50. He leaves with his card.


He comes back about 20 minutes later and says how he wants to return it as he got the wrong one. I apologize and explain how they’re final sale and they’re not a valid tender to be used on gift cards. He keeps trying to explain it to me again on how I need to return this, on how he has the receipt, on how he didn’t need this and apparently I was rushing him. I said unfortunately sir there’s nothing that we can do. He starts to get loud with me now, which I stand my ground because I have no patience. He begins cursing, I say he needs to leave. He’s refusing to leave. I signal to my other SGA, who’s busy making paper snowflakes for the lolz because he’s not on the clock right now, to call security. He goes to the back room and does so. My SGA gets between the guy and I and more calmly now explains how we are unable to refund the gift card. The guy asks if any other store has Roblox gift cards in his heated tone. For the sake of getting the guy out of the store, my SGA looked up the Roblox SKU - which nobody had in stock and he explained this to the guest. The guest proceeded to come behind the counter to look at the POS as my SGA said he can’t be back here. He pushed my SGA back, my SGA stood his ground, the guy began to yell at my SGA, my SGA kept saying he needs to go. I step next to my SGA to make sure if the guy throws a punch, I’d intercept it because there’s no way I’m letting my employees get hurt on my watch. Mall security ends up showing up and slowly walks up to the counter. I explain they need to have this guy removed from my store and deal with this situation outside. They decide to ignore me, still have the guy behind my counter and they speak to him there as the guy is still aggressively yelling. One of the guards tells him to come out from behind the counter and they now speak to this guy 5 feet from my counter. I repeat again how this guy needs to leave my store. One of the guards comes to me and says they’re dealing with it as the guy is still yelling in my store and causing a commotion, disrupting my business and scaring my customers. I tell the guard he is a safety hazard. He proceeds to tell me he can’t do anything unless he gets physical, I explain he literally put his hands on my employee. I keep fucking repeating this because despite me saying this, security basically says so what. I said he needs to leave. He eventually says, I can see why he’s agitated. I asked for his name and instead he called his supervisor. As soon as this interaction happens, they have the guy go outside. Not before the guy decided to call my SGA a f****t and call me a bitch, which we both owned up to those words. During the refusal of security asking this guy to step outside, my off the clock SGA called the cops.


My SGA & I are heated. We try to go on business as usual. We still hear the guy yelling outside. One of the cleaners of the mall comes in and we chat with him with what happens. Then the head of security comes in, the guard I have a problem with and a random guard come in with him. I’m explaining the situation of what happened and exactly of what his guard said to me and the lack of care the guards were doing to handle the situation. One of the guards said what are we supposed to do? I responded - your fucking jobs, huh? They both get heated at my response, the head waves them off, I still speak to him and he explains how they can’t touch people - I said okay, that’s fine, but at no point was there a conversation of “hey let’s go talk about this outside” or anything of the sort. The guy was disrupting my business and your guards weren’t keeping anyone safe. Fun fact, the mall cancelled our phone call to the police.

2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fc3425d1640>,,GameStop,"So my son was trying to buy Diablo 3 for ps4, he is 17 but didn’t have ID on him. First the guy checking us out said he could save money if he bought preowned on a Pokémon game…then couldn’t find it….so whatever but then…..he asked for ID for Diablo…(uh this is the first time ever that this has happened to us there) but ok wouldn’t sell it to him, whatever that’s fine. Told him I would just buy it then no biggie….he looked at me and said “nope I cannot sell this to you blah blah blah” he then slammed his hand on the game and slid it across the counter and threw it behind him. I then had to tell my teenage daughter (who was next in line) to go put her game back because it was rated “M” too.

I said well why don't we try it anyways, and sure enough, they do not. Therefore there is no proof of purchase. They did not want anything in the store, if it was store credit, I would have made an exception. They wanted cash back. I explained to them since we could not prove that they purchased the game, at GameStop, there was no way I could give them a refund. And since the game is so new, it's not eligible for trade either. They asked me if I could look up the transaction with their credit card, and I said no. There's not a way for me to enter credit card information. Then they proceeded to ask if they can show me their bank statements, I said that on bank statements, it would state how much the total is, and then the company. And while the total might match, there's no way to prove that they bought this specific game. And that's not proof of purchase.
Because I felt like I was shutting them down, I told them that if they wanted to go back to the location that they bought it at, they might get lucky and the person who run them up might be there, and remember them, and would do the return for them. They said that they didn't want to do that, because they've been driving, and why can't I just do it for them.

2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fc3425d1640>,,GameStop,"I have seen far too many posts and comments saying that the $5 coupon is changing.  Too many posts saying that the only change is 5% off used. 

Here is the actual info regarding the new pro:

1. The monthly $5 is literally identical and unchanged.

2. The points will be usable for everything except gift cards.  Your monthly $5 will still work, just not coupons earned by redeeming points.

3. The points will expire so actually use them to save more money and get more value.  Hoarding hundreds of thousands of points and never spending them does nothing and never has.  The most that can be used at one time is 90k points.  (I don't think it's good they expire, but it's the reality now so don't be dumb)

4. You now will get 5% off all used items (even consoles), warranties, gamestop branded items, atrix branded items, clearance, collectibles, and trading cards.

5.  You only need to save $10.01 using the discounts to save more than you would with the $15 membership.  That's a card collector buying 3 etbs and 1 pack in an entire year.  Not 3 more than they used to, just 3 total with no other purchases all year.

6. We will now be able to redeem points for you so it will be easier to save using them.

7. You will still get the same welcome offer or renewal bonus that you always did.

8. GameInformer will now come as a digital edition for all members. Print copies will be available for purchase for anyone at a price of $6.99, and pros get their 5% off of it, too.  If you've currently paid for a physical membership, you will continue to receive them for the next year.

9. The price is changing from $15 a year to $25 a year starting June 27, 2023. Anyone with an active account will receive these new benefits with no additional charge until their account is up for renewal.  People are still able to sign up (or renew if you are in your last 3 months) for the $15 until close on June 26, 2023.

I know a lot of people on this sub see any change as bad change, but these same things were said about Elite Pro before it launched.

Too many posts saying that the only change is 5% off used. </p>

<p>Here is the actual info regarding the new pro:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The monthly $5 is literally identical and unchanged.</p></li>
<li><p>The points will be usable for everything except gift cards.  Your monthly $5 will still work, just not coupons earned by redeeming points.</p></li>
<li><p>The points will expire so actually use them to save more money and get more value.  Hoarding hundreds of thousands of points and never spending them does nothing and never has.  The most that can be used at one time is 90k points.  (I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good they expire, but it&#39;s the reality now so don&#39;t be dumb)</p></li>
<li><p>You now will get 5% off all used items (even consoles), warranties, gamestop branded items, atrix branded items, clearance, collectibles, and trading cards.</p></li>
<li><p>You only need to save $10.01 using the discounts to save more than you would with the $15 membership.  That&#39;s a card collector buying 3 etbs and 1 pack in an entire year.  Not 3 more than they used to, just 3 total with no other purchases all year.</p></li>
<li><p>We will now be able to redeem points for you so it will be easier to save using them.</p></li>
<li><p>You will still get the same welcome offer or renewal bonus that you always did.</p></li>
<li><p>GameInformer will now come as a digital edition for all members. Print copies will be available for purchase for anyone at a price of $6.99, and pros get their 5% off of it, too.  If you&#39;ve currently paid for a physical membership, you will continue to receive them for the next year.</p></li>
<li><p>The price is changing from $15 a year to $25 a year starting June 27, 2023. Anyone with an active account will receive these new benefits with no additional charge until their account is up for renewal.  People are still able to sign up (or renew if you are in your last 3 months) for the $15 until close on June 26, 2023.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know a lot of people on this sub see any change as bad change, but these same things were said about Elite Pro before it launched. Stop being all doom and gloom about every change, put some thought into how to make it worth it for people instead of bad mouthing it. That will only make things harder on yourselves when it launches.  Don&#39;t hope for it to fail; hope for it to succeed.</p>

2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fc3425d1640>,,GameStop,"Dear District Manager, you know me. I live on this subreddit, I moderate the hell out of it. Corporate has willingly doxxed me so they know who I am. DMs in our region and in others know who I am, but I’m here writing this today because you missed my call.


I’m here saying as a tenured employee who returned back from leave, you’ve left me stranded since I’ve came back. You have not done a singular thing to help me in my stores. You gave me the benefit of the doubt to have a conversation one time, but just that singular time. I guess that was my get out of Jail free card because now you tend to ignore the fuck out of me.


Dear District Manager, I called a store manager today and I started to scream. You’ve been nothing but an overglorified SL. You’ve not shown that you have the ability to support people. You’ve shown that you have the ability to borderline harass people to the point where they feel like they need to quit. You think we are robots, we’re not. We’re humans with outside lives believe it or not. We don’t recite how to upsell a customer on this item or that. With that being said, you send us home thinking that we’re going to be next. The next one you’re going to get rid of because you offer no support to those struggling SLs. You act like we’re racing horses. As soon as one of us gets a broken leg, you shoot to kill and try to find another one. We’re just numbers to you, that’s all.


Dear District Manager, you set me up for failure. You’ve neglected to inform me of changes to certain company based things that **three of my peers explained to me how you knew this** when I called all of them today. You lied to me and said you knew no such thing. My staff communicated with you while you were on leave. My two stores are very uniformed. You kept feeding them two different types of information constantly that would contradict the other. I had to decipher the confusion for them when I wasn’t around because you don’t understand proper communication. Ultimately, you lied to both stores for them to do the complete opposite thing of each other. You lied to me, stating I couldn’t promote someone. When I got higherups involved, you tried to make me look like the idiot saying you said no such thing. You’ve illegally tampered with a peers leave status, but I don’t know too much so I’ll leave that one at that.


Dear District Manager, you’ve had my peers reach out to you for help. You’ve ignored them. Then you come at them when you confront them about the problem they tried to come to you for. You act like you’ve never heard such thing. Many of my peers record conversations. Our state is a one consent state. I’ve heard conversations of you yelling and belittling people on conference calls and in person. Is this how you manage people? I keep my head down and to myself as I don’t want to bring myself to any sort of attention, but you make me feel like I’m next as you often ignore me.


Dear District Manager, you didn’t help me. I learned new things from my ASL and the **other** District Managers phone numbers who can be bothered to pick up my phone call. They answer their phone because they’re something called salaried. Those DMs don’t inform the caller to call their store peers who are off the clock before they call them. You’re not an outside hire, you know the Employee Handbook. why are you advising on making an HR violation.


And lastly, dear district manager, I’m done playing nice. I’m worrying about what I’ve got to do now. The stress you’ve caused me almost made me drop my keys. I’ve never once considered it in my time here. I’ve had DMs mentally destroy me, but you’ve truly made me see how much I could hate this job due to the lack of support for you. Quite frankly, none of us need you. You don’t inform us on important information - our peers need to bring it up all the time. You don’t offer support or help - we gotta fend for ourselves. You dictate this district like a tyrant and not a respectable person.


People aren’t quitting because of GameStop right now, people are quitting because of you. It’ll probably be to late before you get this message, you’ll probably leave me on read as your iPhone states. It’s okay. I understand. You accepted the promotion for the pay raise and not the responsibility that came with it. 

Sincerely, yours truly.

This morning I decided ""you know what? I don't need this anymore, I'm gonna wrap up the week and call it quits"" (Genuinely don't need it, GS has always been a side-gig). 

It's just not worth it anymore, man. Between the changes to Pro and Warranties, and the other changes coming down the way apparently, *none* of us get paid enough to be ground-level customer punching bags because corporate's going to take a fat steaming crap on everything. But I do take pride in being a professional to a point, not ""Here's my two weeks"" to a point, mind you, definitely more of a ""I'll finish the week then you're on your own.""

So, I decide to send an email to the DM, who I'd been back and fourth with often recently due to an SL change at my store and decided to politely yet bluntly air my grievances whilst giving my notice that I'd be handing in my keys this Saturday. One of those grievances was that I was looking to transfer stores when my old SL left to go to a location closer to home that I knew and they knew needed people (I currently drive about 45 minutes to an hour to get to my current store. Yes, I liked my old SL that much and they're missed considerably), yet my DM was leaving me hanging for almost a month and a half now on the transfer, while also telling me it was ""a done deal"". Come to find out, he wasn't putting in the transfer at all because the current store I'm at is such a shitshow that it can't afford to lose anyone else, and was hoping I'd ignorantly ride out the holidays at this location. Sorry chief, not happening, so I put in my notice.

Barely a few minutes go by, and the store's phone rings, it's the DM, who immediately goes into placating with ""Well I can push the transfer through and get you somewhere closer to home, but we're currently in some 'fast times' here at GameStop, and you might not be entering a much better situation you know. But give me 24 hours and I'll set things right.""

He chose to completely miss the part where I said that the policy changes were the tipping point for me, and that I 👏don't 👏need 👏this👏 crap! So I told him that, and it finally came out of his mouth over the phone:

""Please reconsider, it's bad everywhere and we need people like you. Just give me the day to figure this out, that's all I ask. Can you please do that and I'll reach out tomorrow?"" I told him that one way or another I'm finishing the week and that I'll be around for now, so if he wants to call, go for it. Naturally, my mind's made up.

<p>Barely a few minutes go by, and the store&#39;s phone rings, it&#39;s the DM, who immediately goes into placating with &quot;Well I can push the transfer through and get you somewhere closer to home, but we&#39;re currently in some &#39;fast times&#39; here at GameStop, and you might not be entering a much better situation you know. But give me 24 hours and I&#39;ll set things right.&quot;</p>

<p>He chose to completely miss the part where I said that the policy changes were the tipping point for me, and that I 👏don&#39;t 👏need 👏this👏 crap! So I told him that, and it finally came out of his mouth over the phone:</p>

<p>&quot;Please reconsider, it&#39;s bad everywhere and we need people like you. Just give me the day to figure this out, that&#39;s all I ask. Can you please do that and I&#39;ll reach out tomorrow?&quot; I told him that one way or another I&#39;m finishing the week and that I&#39;ll be around for now, so if he wants to call, go for it. Naturally, my mind&#39;s made up. </p>

<p>Y&#39;all why am I having to break up with my damn DM? It&#39;s retail, man, it&#39;s not that deep.</p>

He then tells me about how he has a massive Zelda collection. Showed me pictures and we talked for a good while about how Zelda has both impacted us. For my night release, I made trivia and little hand made prizes for people.  It was a fantastic experience.  Everyone was laughing, high fives and so many kids were there flexing their Zelda knowlege. 

For that guys almost heartbreak of not getting a collectors edition. I gave him a master sword key chain I made. 

""I'll be be back tonight with something from my collection for you""

He came with the little old man from the original LoZ that gives you your first sword. Fair trade for his legendary blade. 

To be honest, I almost left GS. What was I thinking? I understand everyone has their own personal experience with any job, but after tonight, I dont think I could experience the same satisfaction of the kids tonight. I hid a hand made Korok in the store and who ever found it got a gift card. This little girl found him almost immediately. The smiles were all over, the atmosphere was fantastic.

He had his ticket for a collectors edition at another store. Unfortunately they miss counted and his copy was sold. He races to my store hoping that I still had some. I did of course.</p>

<p>He then tells me about how he has a massive Zelda collection. Showed me pictures and we talked for a good while about how Zelda has both impacted us. For my night release, I made trivia and little hand made prizes for people.  It was a fantastic experience.  Everyone was laughing, high fives and so many kids were there flexing their Zelda knowlege. </p>

<p>For that guys almost heartbreak of not getting a collectors edition. I gave him a master sword key chain I made. </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll be be back tonight with something from my collection for you&quot;</p>

<p>He came with the little old man from the original LoZ that gives you your first sword. Fair trade for his legendary blade. </p>

<p>To be honest, I almost left GS. What was I thinking? I understand everyone has their own personal experience with any job, but after tonight, I dont think I could experience the same satisfaction of the kids tonight. I hid a hand made Korok in the store and who ever found it got a gift card. This little girl found him almost immediately. The smiles were all over, the atmosphere was fantastic.</p>

You don't get to say 'we value and appreciate you' after you make us run single coverage, compromising our safety and mental health juggling more tasks, volume, shipment than would be reasonable for several people.

You don't get to say 'we value and appreciate you' after you threaten our jobs if we don't take on twice as much responsibility with a second store for an extra dollar an hour.

You don't get to say 'we value and appreciate you' after you reduce our pay eliminating 4 hours over time weekly which we depend on to provide for our family.

You don't get to say 'we value and appreciate you' after you remove short and long term disability and increase our insurance costs on top of reducing our wages.

You don't get to say 'we value and appreciate you' after you change the PRO program, return policies, what gift cards can be used for etc purely in the interest of profit over customer satisfaction leaving us as the punching bag on a very anti customer culture.

-If you googled our phone number, our store hours and location is right there. Don't ask when we close for the love of bob. 

-""I'm looking for a game."" My guy! What game on what console, it's not a hard sentence. ""Hey, I was wondering if you had any pre-owned copies of _______ on ______"". WAY EASIER! 

-Literal children calling. I'm single coverage, 12 boxes of distro, and I suddenly have a line. We don't have time for the ""um....uh...um...do you have um....cod? Mom what's the game again?!?!?"" If I can hear an adult in the background, I'm even more pissed. Don't have your kids call us. 

-Prank Calls. Go waste a big box store with that bs, we have no time. No, we don't have ""Call of Mario on the PSP"". (And before anyone says it, yes. I am slowly programming the pranks into the phone so we don't pick them up but then they still call 3-5 times) 

- Bitching to me that I didn't pick up the last two times you called. Again, mostly solo coverage. If I have a customer in front of me they come first. I don't have a clone to sit on the phone with you to walk you through your fraudulent steam cards.

So I get done looking around & tell the employee “ let’s just put that $25 towards the new Avatar game “. 

Employee: “ ohh well it looks like you actually have $60 now after canceling an old pre-order “. 

Me: “ old pre order? What are you talking about? LoL

Employee: “ looks like you had Anthem ( fucking Anthem 🤣🤣🤣) pre-ordered. I cancelled it for you so now you have that on your account. “

Me: “ you’ve got to be kidding me right? Over the past 5 years your the first employee to let me know this? Haha “

Employee: “ I guess so “

Me: “ Well thank you very much, let’s put it all towards Avatar please “


Now what’s even funnier about this whole situation is the fact I bought Anthem (hardcopy) from some place & played the game for about a month. 

Meaning I pre-ordered it at GameStop, forgot that I did that & then bought it someplace else 🤣🤣🤣

The reason why Gamestop has been circling the drain is because time and time and time again the upper management shows that they have no fucking clue what brings people to stores. The revolving door of CEOs taking turns bending us over to rake in what they can and dip has led to a streak of some of the most bafflingly anti-consumer cost cutting I have ever witnessed. 

Wanna know what would have saved Gamestop some money? Investing in the community. Treating your employees like indentured servants under the guise of ""family"" demolishes morale. The employees are the personal friends of the customers, regulars cant stand to support a corporate entity that forces hard quotas, 2SL, and shit hours. 

You've got loyal employees that love their communities drinking the kool-aid, jumping through hurdles and mental gymnastics to justify each anti-consumer practice of the month. The amount of corporate doublethink being spoonfed to some of the hardest retail workers I've ever met fucking kills me to see every time. GOOD PEOPLE with Stockholm syndrome for a company that will squeeze every little bit of passion out of them for another buck. 

And surely closing down some of the best locations with tight knit communities will improve profitability! I'm sure people would LOVE to trudge their way over to the hole in the wall dead plaza Gamestops instead! Plenty lively over there. 

I'm sorry mine and many other canceled pro memberships are going to be a hit on the employees numbers but corporate has to see that this shit is bleeding out the last few reasons to be a Gamestop regular. I used to be proud to work at my childhood Gamestop now this shit is embarrassing for the employees and the customers.

2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fc3425d1640>,,GameStop,"I have been working here for a little over 6 months, my store has been going through hell since last month. My manager who I was super happy to work with got promoted and wasn't my manager anymore. For about a month the store had been in limbo with who was gonna be our next manager (the choice was between a coworker or a random manager from another store, I got the news the random manager would be my new manager later).
I've been working open to closes aka 12 hour shifts for 2-3 weeks. Mentally I am fried and so tired. My manager (technically ex manager) couldn't help, nobody else was available to help share the shift with me. I posted a question on main menu about keeping my sanity during these clopens and some ass hat was like ""iT's NOt ThaT HaRd!!!"". I made sure to be rude back to her before I quit lmao.

Anyway, I was 2 hours from closing yesterday and some dude came in to pick up his zelda oled. I do the transaction, he asks to renew the membership so I do that for him. I tell him that I try not to overly push the membership unless my manager is around (I literally don't have a new manager until tomorrow). Apparently he knows my old manager and CALLED HIM. He told my old manager about what I said.

I get a phone call maybe 20 minutes later, my old manager is pissed. He has never spoken to me like this ever. He scolded me like a child, saying I have to do better, it's embarrassing, that he's so disappointed in me, I'll get in trouble if a new manager hears of my ""horrible behavior"". After the phone call I immediately wrote a note saying ""I quit. Bye bye :)"" and signed my name. I do not get paid enough ($13.50 an hour btw) to sell memberships when I'm working a 40 hour week with mostly solo coverage. I couldn't care less about my numbers.

My manager who I was super happy to work with got promoted and wasn&#39;t my manager anymore. For about a month the store had been in limbo with who was gonna be our next manager (the choice was between a coworker or a random manager from another store, I got the news the random manager would be my new manager later).
I&#39;ve been working open to closes aka 12 hour shifts for 2-3 weeks. Mentally I am fried and so tired. My manager (technically ex manager) couldn&#39;t help, nobody else was available to help share the shift with me. I posted a question on main menu about keeping my sanity during these clopens and some ass hat was like &quot;iT&#39;s NOt ThaT HaRd!!!&quot;. I made sure to be rude back to her before I quit lmao.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was 2 hours from closing yesterday and some dude came in to pick up his zelda oled. I do the transaction, he asks to renew the membership so I do that for him. I tell him that I try not to overly push the membership unless my manager is around (I literally don&#39;t have a new manager until tomorrow). Apparently he knows my old manager and CALLED HIM. He told my old manager about what I said.</p>

<p>I get a phone call maybe 20 minutes later, my old manager is pissed. He has never spoken to me like this ever. He scolded me like a child, saying I have to do better, it&#39;s embarrassing, that he&#39;s so disappointed in me, I&#39;ll get in trouble if a new manager hears of my &quot;horrible behavior&quot;. After the phone call I immediately wrote a note saying &quot;I quit. Bye bye :)&quot; and signed my name. I do not get paid enough ($13.50 an hour btw) to sell memberships when I&#39;m working a 40 hour week with mostly solo coverage. I couldn&#39;t care less about my numbers. My coworker was kind enough to close for me so I could leave my keys. I&#39;m a part time employee going through college, these past few weeks have been AWFUL.

Clearly reddit is for hating GameStop. 
Yet many of us on this reddit still work here.

Why?

We know it's not for the pay. That's all I see anyone ever do is complain about not getting decent pay. 

So then why?  We all know you can get a better job at any moment by simply looking. What are you holding on to?

Despite people thinking I'm a Regional sting operation for reddit, I actually like the job. 
I offer my condolences to everyone else that hates it, and I understand why people hate it.

I don't doubt for a second that the company will die off at some point. I'm along for that ride, and I'm going to enjoy it while I do because I truly believe this is the end of the physical game shop experience where gamers interact with people that are passionate about the same thing.

""Best Buy, Target, Walmart enter the chat""...
Meanwhile at Best buy (empty shelves).

You guys really think shopping for games at Walmart feels ideal? Waiting for some random employee to pop in and open a window cabinet for your selected game that doesn't care or know shit about it? That's what I'm getting at here.

It's the experience. That's going to be over when GameStop disappears. Yes you'll be able to buy games at Target or Walmart, but it won't be the same experience. 

I'm still here because I actually like working at GameStop. I like my team, I like my bosses, And I like my costumers. And believe it or not (I know most refuse to believe it) my pay is good. I wouldn't be able to afford my rent or my bills if it wasn't. My experience in the company has always been positive, I've been shown appreciation, and have been compensated for my performance. I wish everyone else had that too. It sucks that most people here don't seem to get that experience.

I think pay is a solid reason to leave. 
I respect that. I also think feeling pressure to hit astronomically impossible sounding goals is a solid reason to leave. Yet you're still here?

I realize I'm going to get down voted.
But I'm just curious why everyone else stays.

Me: ""How's it going?""

I enter his info, shows he has LotF standard for Series X pre-ordered. We have 0 on hand. I check item movement to see if someone accidentally sold it or something, but we just never got it in distro. Nothing is in transit, either.

C: ""So you ain't got my game? Whatever man. Just cancel it and give me my shit back.""

It was already late in the day, and I was solid on Res, so I didn't even argue with the guy that I could request a copy from the warehouse or call a local store and see if they had any extra copies. So I agree to cancel it. 

I grab a trade credit card and swipe it, customer immediately flies off on me.

C: ""What the fuck is that?""

Around mid-afternoon, a man walked in with his adorable 2-year-old kid in tow. At first, everything seemed normal. He was polite and charming, striking up a conversation about the latest gaming releases. Little did I know?? this was all part of an elaborate distraction??
As I was busy chatting with him about the Spiderman Ps5, he skillfully maneuvered his toddler around the store, keeping our attention divided. You know how kids are at gamestop… touching, moving around and throwing everything. I had another associate with me AND we were pretty busy at the time. Honestly, he definitely waited until we were busy to pull this off. That's when it happened – the dude swiftly??? ripped the ps5 / xbox controllers off of the magnetic peg hooks and stashed them into a bag he had brought with him. Our store is usually low traction so we keep multiples of each kind of controller on display (also customers bring bookbags in all the time at my store, I honestly didn’t think too much about it.) I still have no clue how he did this because I feel like we would’ve been able to hear it.

It wasn't until my other coworker got a phone call from another store that a guy also robbed them of their controllers with his kid. We were in absolute shock and disbelief. We literally had NO clue that they were doing it. 

Obviously by the time we got the call it was too late. Also he was visibly armed LOL so there wasn’t really anything we could do bc no way in hell i am risking my life for gamestop.

You know how kids are at gamestop… touching, moving around and throwing everything. I had another associate with me AND we were pretty busy at the time. Honestly, he definitely waited until we were busy to pull this off. That&#39;s when it happened – the dude swiftly??? ripped the ps5 / xbox controllers off of the magnetic peg hooks and stashed them into a bag he had brought with him. Our store is usually low traction so we keep multiples of each kind of controller on display (also customers bring bookbags in all the time at my store, I honestly didn’t think too much about it.) I still have no clue how he did this because I feel like we would’ve been able to hear it.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until my other coworker got a phone call from another store that a guy also robbed them of their controllers with his kid. We were in absolute shock and disbelief. We literally had NO clue that they were doing it. </p>

<p>Obviously by the time we got the call it was too late. Also he was visibly armed LOL so there wasn’t really anything we could do bc no way in hell i am risking my life for gamestop. I immediately called the police the second he left WHICH TOOK THEM 45 MINUTES TO SHOW UP… It was a surreal experience, and I can&#39;t believe how smoothly he pulled it off using his child as a distraction</p>

The place we used to be, back when midnight launches were a real party, when it wasn't unheard of to get 300 reserves on an annual title, when the customers were actually happy to come into the store, when we had a minimum of 118 hours to go around every week, and when our holiday schedules were two pages full of people. Back when seasonals were actually necessary and all stores had an assistant manager instead of just getting one as a gold star reward for being shafted by the resurrection of the SL2 program. Back when Vegas conference was so big that it felt like it took half an hour to walk across the breakfast hall and three times that to get back to your room at the end of the day. Back in the days where GameStop actually meant something to the gaming industry at large instead of the joke/footnote it has become.

My employees brought me to tears today. I tried to hold it together, but I ugly cried when I got into the car. Everyone showed up, even the ones that weren't scheduled. Gave me a gift card to a local place and told me to take my spouse on a date. Told me to not be a stranger and that maybe we can be friends now that I'm not their boss. One wrote a note thanking me for giving them a chance and believing in them, which I'm going to keep forever as a reminder that I've made a positive impact. I've told them all for months, even before I put in my notice, that I'd always have their backs. That if they were trying to leave they didn't need to worry about telling me because they deserved better than GameStop was willing to give and that I'd always give them a glowing recommendation. Now that I'm gone they've still got me to put down as a reference, but now they've also got my gamertag now so we can all play some Baldur's Gate together. I wouldn't have been able to keep things running without their support and I will be eternally grateful to them.

I'm going to miss all of my employees and most of my colleagues. I'm even going to miss my DM because they're the only boss I've ever had who never once failed me any time they said ""trust me, I've got you"". They did their best to help us navigate all of these awful changes from corporate. (And boss I know you're probably reading this, so just so you know, we can ALL tell you hate these changes as much as we do even though you can't say it).

To corporate, I see what you're doing. The writing is on the wall for anyone who cares to look. Failing stocks in lieu of raises, removing overtime (aka 18% paycuts), slashing benefits, slashing payroll, bringing back the failed SL2 program. Those four weekly hours of overtime are what you gave us when we switched from salary in order to match our salary pay. How many tenured managers are now making less today than they were seven years ago? I'm genuinely disgusted.

To my peers, know your worth and truly understand the skills that you've cultivated in your time here. I know there aren't too many left with 10+ years, but that time is enough to negate most bachelors degree requirements for a 9-5 office job once you take the time to write a good resume. For those of you who are newer, which I definitely saw at conference, learn all you can, hone your skills, and run as soon as you get a chance at a better opportunity.

I don't think I'm ever going to be in another working environment where I feel half as much support as I've gotten from my peers or where I am so genuinely encouraged to be myself. I've got so many memories, both good and bad. I've made friends that I will treasure forever. I've gained confidence in my own abilities that I don't think I could have cultivated without the support of the person who hired me and the team I surrounded myself with.

## The bad news

Based on the memos and cost-cutting changes coming from Lord Dog Food, I have to say that it's looking like he's positioning the company to file for bankruptcy. There are different types of bankruptcy, but the terms are more favorable if you're able to demonstrate that you've taken due-diligence measures to cut costs before you file. That is the reason for the recent customer-repellent changes such as downgraded Pro perks and the new warranty policy.

This is about making sure the C-Suite's golden parachute is solid gold; it's not about ""saving the company"". While I'm going to sorely miss being able to visit GameStop when I go to the mall with my family, it's a business that simply doesn't make sense anymore financially.

**So please understand:** Killing yourselves to hit the numbers that corporate is demanding of you is *not* going to save your job. Nothing will.

## The good news

You essentially have nothing to lose.

Strip away the ridiculous demands from corporate, and you are working a job that a lot of us dreamed of growing up.

Your days are numbered, so **why not make this job what it should have been all along?**

Here's my recommendation:

## Do's

- **Do continue to help customers make the best purchase decisions for themselves and their children.** There are asshole customers, but to most folks, you are video game experts. Enjoy that to its greatest extent. I remember working at Babbages in the 90s and stopping a mom from buying an N64 for her son by asking her what his friends play (Playstation). Having been the only kid in my town with an Atari 5200, I still feel great about probably making that kid's Christmas.

- **Do stay out of jail**. Although the company is a sinking ship, if the checks and balances don't add up, they can still bring you to court. So no super special discounts or anything.

## Don'ts

- **Don't stress out over metrics!!** GS is already working with a skeleton crew at each location. They can hem and haw all day, but they need at least 1 person who actually knows the systems and processes at each location. You're not going to get fired until they're ready to shut down the store.

- **Don't pitch warranties you don't believe in.** Use your judgement about whether or not a warranty will truly be worth it for a given customer.

- **Don't kill yourself over pre-orders.** If *you* think something might be difficult to get ahold of without pre-ordering (and you feel confident that GS can acquire adequate stock to cover pre-orders on that item), then fine. Otherwise, no.

- **Don't take trades you don't want to**. Someone brings in an XBONE that's sticky or smells of smoke? Tell them to sell it on eBay. Corporate likes to tell you to ""think like an owner"". Here's a perfect opportunity to do so.

TL;DR - GameStop is going to close.  If you work there and love games, try to just enjoy the time you have left by running your store the way you want to.

Associate informed me that my membership expired on 11/04 and asked if I wanted to renew. I politely declined mainly because I like to fully research things before signing up. Especially true after all the negative Pro changes in the past year.

As part of the research, I visited this sub and learned of the lastest horrors corporate is throwing at you and the customer. Quickly decided the plan - and frankly GameStop - was no longer fit for my business.

Went in today to make sure I used my final $5 benefit on another PlayStation card. Associate saw my membership expired tomorrow and put on the hard sell.

Me: ""No thank you.""

Associate: ""Are you sure? You'll lose your $5 monthly coupon if you don't sign up again.""

Me: ""No thank you.""

Associate: ""You've saved $____ money because of your membership. Are you sure? You'd be throwing away free money. Why don't you want to renew?""

Me: ""I don't approve of the changes to the Pro plan in the past year, specifically not being able to use the $5 coupon on currency cards next month. I also don't like that I can no longer use the gift cards I get for trading in on currency either.""

Associate: ""They might change the POSA again - just like they did last time. And not being able to use gift cards to get digital currency isn't just a GameStop thing - the vendors are restricting that. It's the same policy that Walmart and Best Buy have. Even if those go away though, you'll still get the trade bonus and extra percent off on all your purchases. Are you sure you don't want to renew.""

Me: ""I will not be renewing.""

At this point, the associate finally finalized the purchase so I could input my card and compete the transaction

Thank to this sub for spreading the information about Pro so consumers could make an honest and informed choice.

If these numbers are absolutely that important to you, let us store leaders shed some advice.

1. Bring back the trade commission bonuses for ALL associates. Trade numbers have tanked company wide since you did away with it.

2. Bring back the Store Leader overtime you promised so many of us to get us in the door and to appease the change from salary to hourly. $400+ a month is what we have lost and it’s not what we hired on for.

3. Start paying commission bonuses on your pro and warranties. Motivate your associates to sell this shit instead of taking away all motivation and expecting them to work harder.

4. The stock equity plan is shit. I’d rather work salary than watch the $24k you handed me tank to under $17k in 6mo. That’s right, with the equity plan and taking away overtime, you’ll cost me just shy of $13k in income this year.

5. Give us payroll hours. Periodt.

Had a meeting with my DM, Through out the meeting he was twisting situations and my words. I called him out because I don't have anything to lose at this point. He said ""Im sorry you feel that way"" and I was like no, I don't feel anything, its a fact your are twisting my words.

I stated ""GAME isn't a realistic model that fits each customer"" 

then he said ""so you aren't gonna do GAME is what your saying"" 

no..

 He said I ignore guests and sit on my phone, I ask for one video showing me doing this, despite him saying he had multiple examples he couldn't provide we with one.

After not being able to provide an example, he accused me of being aggressive, and yelling, telling me to calm down. I was calm. I was just sitting there confused, as he said he was ""in fear"" and needed to call HR. I brought out my phone to record cause I wasn't gonna have this situation be flipped on me. I do have a small clip of them both saying (Hr and Dm) that they don't give me consent to record (I live in a 1 party state tho)

I just got up and left, saying I wasn't gonna stay in this situation and be accused of doing things I am not, and not being able to have my own evidence that shows I am not.

We're not just bombarding you with questions at the register for our health. Yea, they yell at us about our numbers so it does help us as employees. Though that's not your problem as a customer.

Now idk if it’s the same for every district or every store (probably not) but that is what we we are told to do. 

Now I myself always found this “new change” odd and a bit exaggerating to say the least but after my manager and my DM spoken to us the team about it and why we push for this policy from here on out I guess in the end it all make sense.

I have worked my ass off for you for a while now, I’ve climbed and am continuing to climb your ladder of bullshit rapidly. Time and time again I have adapted to your policies and time and time again I have consistently performed above all metrics. I’ve won contests from the District Manager, and the corporate level. I worked at three stores to help cover staffing issues.  I have never called off sick. I have been late a handful of times but only once or twice did my store open late. I ran your store with no SL or ASL above me for months when I first started. I have been through 5 store leaders and 3 assistants. I’ve been promoted, I’ve been promoted again, I’m looking forward to being promoted once more in a little here. I love my District Manager. I love my DMIT. I love my Store Lead. I love my Staff.  I have proved time and time again that I am loyal to YOU as a company. I’d like to think I haven’t wronged you. 

So why. Why? Why do I get no hours to run my store? Why am I being lied to from everyone above me? Are they even lies? Is it just poor communication? Why when I find more gears to hit, do you ask for more? Why do you always make my life harder than it needs to be? Why can’t I give my SGA’s raises that they deserve when I can hire new employees at higher rates? Why are you taking the SL who is training me to be an SL, away half the time? Why can you not realize that you are having staff issues because you cannot pay bottom dollar wages and expect a metric and performance based job to be coveted? Why can’t you just help? Why can’t you just listen? I get times are tough. They are. I will not be unreasonable, but I need you to help. This job isn’t fun. It is not even tolerable. I want to quit. I want to run and never look back. I want my SL to be happy. I want my staff to like their job a little bit. I want my District Manager to be proud. To never have to worry about my store. 

I love my community, my regulars, my general customers. I love my bosses. I love my staff, I’m trying to do better for them. I want you to be nothing more than consistent. Because, I’m burnt out. I am very tired. I don’t know what to do. I do everything for you. Help me. Please.

Best of luck to y’all. Make sure you pre count before you start pre ringing and after you close to ensure the accuracy of your inventory. Get rid of those CEs as fast as you can so you don’t have to worry about them. Bring snacks and drinks **for yourself**, you know it’s going to be a long night. It’s not your fault how many CEs, amiibos, whatever the hell you have in - as that’s what corporate sent you.


Lastly… if you run out of pre order bonuses, make sure you grab an axe.


Seriously. Y’all stay safe, keep hydrated and most importantly try to have fun. I always made the most of midnight releases when I was able to do them - both of my locations are non-midnight locations - and it turned out to typically be a fun time for those who genuinely are excited for the game.

2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7fc3425d1640>,,GameStop,"Since Summer of 2022 I had been offered SL2 three times and I declined it each time. The laughable $1.25 an hour raise was not worth the torpedo to what little work life balance this job has. As sad as it with this company it's considered a luxury for SLs/SL2s to get their days off without interruption or being forced to come in cause someone calls in or no shows. That only gets worse running two stores nevermind how crazy holiday gets running one location. I didn't get pushed out at those other times like other SLs were forced to mainly for a mix of my DM at the time didn't really have a viable replacement and/or I was deemed too valuable to their district performance to lose me as an SL since my store was usually one of the better performing ones in the district so it bought me an extra year.

The SL2 hammer finally dropped on my location at the end of Q1 at the beginning of May this year. My DM at the time came to my store and basically told me he had an SL2 candidate lined up to take both locations in my area so my options were to leave or step down to ASL since I refused SL2 previously. Not wanting to be out of a job and lose my insurance at that time due to having a couple of doctors appointments in the near future I took a $3.50 an hour pay cut and stepped down to full time ASL at my location and I would help the new SL2 taking over transition into their roll with the expectation I would be leaving after a short time to pursue other opportunities.

I started in 2012 hired on as an SGA and quickly promoted to ASL after about 6 months. Spent 5 years as an ASL before being promoted to SL in 2017 and ran my current store until the end of Q1 this year. I had been offered a couple of times between 2020 and 2021 to be moved into the HIPO program (or whatever they're calling it now) to work towards being a DM, but after the 2019 field leadership snap and my very wonderful and tenured DM at the time after over 15 years of service to the GS beast being unceremoniously axed I knew it wasn't in the cards to consider moving up given the long term prospects of the position and company. The January DM layoffs just reinforced that to me.

 Tbh I was already burnt out for close to a year. I guess complacency, comfort level, and relative ease of the job (for me) was why I stuck around. After the step down to ASL in May I updated my resume and found a job at the beginning of July which I started this week. I had to take a $1 an hour pay cut vs what I was making as an SL since it was an entry level position and it's a bit more physically demanding, but it's full time w/benefits with most weekends and holidays off. I was already told if you stick around and do well there will be opportunities for quick advancement making quite a bit above what SLs make.

For those who are sticking around I wish you luck. I've seen a lot of shit in my time with this company. From Net10, to Captain Redbeard and trade me baby, to SLs being moved from salary to wage, to cricket, to expanding collectibles, to ridiculous tech trade pushes, to covid, to the disastrous catalog sections in 2020, to two major field leadership layoffs, and tons of late night launches and everything in between. The stress of not having to worry about my stores numbers even in my off time when I'm not there has already been a nice weight off my shoulders. For the most part I enjoyed my time with the company but it was clear it was time to move on. 

I hope whatever reset comes this Fall won't be too hectic and holiday isn't the complete shitshow for you troopers staying on the at best derelict ship this company currently is. I think it's got a few years left in the tank and given all the recent decisions (move to main menu, increased number of KPIs, more micro-managing, the increase in pro price, etc) I don't think it's going to be any easier and it's only going to get worse with the current brain trust running the company.

And fwiw enjoy conference if you get a chance to go. I was fortunate enough to go to the last three in person between 2017 and 2019 before covid hit and it can be a fun time and many of you promoted in the last couple years didn't get to experience them like you will this year. I'll still be sticking around here some and shopping at my store as I hold no ill will to the company nor my replacement now running my old store and I still like owning physical games. I'm just glad I no longer have to worry about selling pro cards and warranties and reserves. That alone is already a huge weight off my shoulders.

Do your warranty swaps now before they start charging yall monthly for warranties. 

ALWAYS check you receipts because corporate wants employees just to add gpgs and prps and see if the guest notices and rebuttals with “it costs _____ with protection”.

Guest came in and wanted to return a brand new opened copy of Madden. My ASL denied the return and offered the TIC amount if they wanted to sell it back. My ASL asked if the game worked fine as we can only exchange it for the exact one if it’s defective. The guy said the game wasn’t defective and he just wanted another game. The guy started to make a fuss to the point where I intervened and stepped in. My ASL quite literally grabbed the fucking counter mat with the return policy, which was right in front of the guest, held it in his hands and pointed at where it invalidated what he wanted to do. He left and I thought that was it.


He ended up coming back, while we had a line. My ASL was handling people, I was handling online orders. I didn’t realize he was back in the store till he approached my ASL again and said how he’s on the phone with guest services and they said you need to do the return for me.

There is so much that I want to say. I first want to thank you. Thank you for 5 years of memories. Thank you for all of the experience that you have given me, the laughs and all of the growth that you have helped me experience. the lessons that I have learned, I will take with me for the years to come. I will forever cherish the friends, memories, and good times. 

  I also want to say fuck you. there is no reason someone should leave a retail job as traumatized as many of us have. my team and I were traumatized from the many times that you failed us. in my 5 years, I have been yelled at, threatened and guilt tripped and that's only what management has done. I have been forced to work after medical procedures, threats on my life, with COVID, through a worldwide quarantine and after having a weapon pulled on me.

  I hope you know, Gamestop, that you have blood on your hands. every employee that died defending your store died on your hands. and I hope that fact haunts you for the rest of your life. I hope every single higher up can look in the mirror and realize that they are the fucking problem. 

to my district manager, maybe take a second to care about your employees instead of just the numbers. you are NOTHING without us.

to my regional manager, fuck you.

and lastly, to my store leader, I cannot stress this enough. you are the WORST manager I have ever had. it's sad because you and I would have had so much potential as a team had you have even the slight clue how to lead. the fact that your leadership choice is to yell and threaten is beyond me. i hope you take this as an opportunity to grow both as a leader and a human being.

The store I was promoted to be an SL at originally is closing. I didn’t know there was a second wave of closures. I got hit. My consistent top performing B store that I never have to worry about at all. The store that I saved from closure due to a car going through the store and fucking things up the entire month by helping my team refocus (the following year after this event) on goals and meeting our sales quota for that year to the point where we were actually profitable. The store that helped me be confident in the position I am in today to take on one of the highest volume stores in the district and beg to be paired with my original store, when SL2s became a thing, because I knew I could run that store to success with the staff I had in place. The store I met so many faces and have so many stories. The store that I lead with fun, the store that I referred too as Florida because it would be a vacation for me whenever I worked there as there was literally never anything to do.


The sword goes both ways tho. The store that drove me to have so many manic episodes. The store that drove me to hurt myself physically and mentally as the DMs who were above me at the time always told me I was never good enough despite me always being top of the district. The store that had multiple SLs come to it and give me an intervention. The store that gave me panic attacks every single time I wouldn’t hit a certain metric because the DMs made it seem like I was going to lose my job. The store that made me look at customers as numbers.


It’s super fucking bittersweet. It’s nice in terms of never having to walk into a hollow shell of a store that fucked me up in the beginning where to the point of me leaving it made me stronger, but the team I had in place made me want it back. I appreciate the team in my B store tremendously because they’re the ones that would go to bat for me for anything. I’ve never had such a loyal group of people. While speaking to my ASL at my B store and one of my SGAs, both of their responses were “I work for you. As long as you stay, I’m here. Wherever you go, I go.” I love and hate them at the same time. I love how loyal they are, but I also low key hate how they are not selfish. Deep down I do not consider myself as a person of this much worth. These guys always remind me otherwise.


I’ve closed one store before in my time, but I’ve never been the host of a closing store. The stores last day of business is tomorrow. Such short notice truly and dearly fucking sucks. I lost my sleep about the closure last night. Only got an hour of sleep. With being able to tell my staff today, I definitely feel a lot better, but in the end there’s still some sort of initial attachment to that store. I know I’ll get my tears out on the last day, but for fucks sake. A fucking day notice and then all of a sudden close is disheartening and disgusting. No shame to my DM, but 110% at the company. These closures have been so messy lately, it’s really quite terrible.

These closures have been so messy lately, it’s really quite terrible.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the memories.</p>

<p>Edit: cause there seems to be some confusion lol. I’m still employed. I’m just losing my B store.</p>

***Warning Lots of reading here, scroll to the bottom for TLDR***

I'm a helpful person, sometimes too helpful. Now this is where my patience gets tested.

Child visits grandparent as a guardian when mother isn't available. They live in 2 different neighboring states. The grandparent is giving their child the ability to play some games. Okay, it's Fortnite and Roblox, kids loves these games.

They both come into the store as normal customers and the kid wants some currency for both games. Cool, this is normal. I ring them out as usual. They got a membership too, sweet. Gave them their receipt with the cards and off they go with their day. Normal interaction per usual.

I'd expect they know how to redeem these cards. Dead wrong here.

About an hour later, they called saying ""they don't know how to redeem the codes"" and asking me if they're activated. I told them ""Yes"" and there should be instructions in the back of the card as well as tell them that checking out either Roblox's website or watch YouTube videos as a tutorial. Same with Fortnite. They said ""Ok, we'll do that"". Thought that was the end after the conversation on the phone.

You know where this is going...

Nope, the grandparent and child came back to the store with the child's tablet and tells me ""it's not working"" aka they didn't do anything. But I try to help, it's a slow day, slow paced store so I got time.

Now the problems here start to overlay. First Roblox. I have very little knowledge with this app so navigation is a slight learning curve.

Problem #1, grandparent and child does not know the login information for their own Roblox account. The mother set the information up with making their child an email address. Child was too young to understand how logins work. So the grandparent had to call mother (that didn't answer the phone) to find information on how to gain access to the child's email account. With no prevail, the grandparent looks at me saying ""so how do I do this then?"". *Internal facepalm*

Apparently redeeming a Roblox code isn't done through the app, but through the website browser. (That took about 20 minutes to figure that out.) Now we just have to login through the web browser to redeem the code.

Ok, I look through my phone to see if Google has a answer. Apparently there was another way to navigate though this process. Upon research, you can access the account via 1 time code setup.

Problem #2, 1 time code setup gets sent to the email.  Now the problem is where did it get sent to because there was an parental email setup.

Now she had to call like 3 people on who set this one up. Turns out they put it on the grandparent's email address. And you know what happens next, ""I can't login to my email, I don't know the password.""
*Intenal reaction = GDI*

Thank gawd her email password reset verification is only though her phone via SMS. So we reset that password, then get the code to access Roblox and then we entered the Roblox code in the account. Now funds are there.

Problem #3 (This was a short fix.) Converting the currency to Robux. Had to Google that one too.

Now onto Fortnite. Same problems, different game.

They dont know the login information and also had to setup a parental account for Epic Games since the child had restricted access to enter Fortnite codes. So I had to do a step by step setup for her account so they can redeem Fortnite currency. Fortnite is a little more tame, but at this point I'm so internally frustrated. It went as far as reinstalling the entire game because something got messed up from probably what the kid did before coming into the store. (That was another 2 hours.)

They were in store for about 3 hours. And then another hour after the installation. Thankfully they were patient. I helped guests in-between and answered the usual phone calls as they waited. All tasks were done beforehand so it's just helping the guests. Feel bad for the child. Must of been bored out of his mind trying to get his stuff fixed.

Finally all of that is fixed after forever something time passes. They're good to go. Both cards are redeemed and the child can do what he wants to buy stuff on there.

1 week later... Grandparent calls complaining they need a verification code because the mother and child was trying to redeem points for an online purchase. I told her I don't have access to that. That's something that's emailed to you. ""I deleted it"". I told her she can recover that in the trash folder in the email. Surprised surprised, she didn't know how to find that. I even told her that they can hit a button on the same page to resend verification. They can't find it. Told them they can redo the process, but concerned that it's the same code in the trash and thought the new email will go in the email trash.

At this point, I told her to tell the mother and child to go into their nearby GameStop store and have the rep assist them. She tried to tell me that it may be better to have her call me to help them out at a different GameStop when they're there. I just said ""I'll try"". End of conversation.

1.) Why is the grandparent doing all the work for this child who doesn't know much about technology and the mother is just not helping at all?

2.) Why can't the grandparent communicate with the mother to see if they have all the information needed just Incase these things happen? Write all of this down.

3.) How do you not know your passwords for all of your accounts? Make notes somewhere so you dont forget.

4.) Why even bother with all of this if no one is technology literate?

TLDR

Seriously, just tell the child that he's not old enough and let him do something else. No point for them to go through all of this just to buy some cosmetics n stuff that will last him like 2 days. Or just don't buy anything for him on these games. If it's too hard, don't attempt. Sure, technology is hard for people. Don't pop a vein and sanity for these types of scenarios.

This is why we have the weekly password.

It’s not that hard, do NOT finish a transaction over the phone. Period.

I get home and take the console out to test it out and I find that this one has the previous owners data still in it. All their kids names photos and access to their  Nintendo account ECT not a deal breaker but annoying that it seems this store isn't checking their product at all as I got two consoles back to back that were not gone through properly. 
Aside from my biotching, and knowing this is a sub mostly of employees how would you have handled the situation?

EDIT: I returned to the store and got my refund and 15 minutes later after leaving the store the employee called me to argue that he should not have returned the refund to me at all. Continuing to tell me I was wrong.

So I had to buy the warranty over again after getting a console that was defective from the start. I get home and take the console out to test it out and I find that this one has the previous owners data still in it. All their kids names photos and access to their  Nintendo account ECT not a deal breaker but annoying that it seems this store isn&#39;t checking their product at all as I got two consoles back to back that were not gone through properly. 
Aside from my biotching, and knowing this is a sub mostly of employees how would you have handled the situation?</p>

<p>EDIT: I returned to the store and got my refund and 15 minutes later after leaving the store the employee called me to argue that he should not have returned the refund to me at all. Continuing to tell me I was wrong.</p>

<p>EDIT AGAIN: I was told to come back to the store or he would void my warranty. Came to the store talked it over asked for the store manager he said he was the manager. I called customer service again on speaker and they told him that I was in the right. Idk why this was this hard thank you guys for the insight and the place to vent</p>

Turns out he wanted to get rid of me because I wouldn't flirt with him. 

I called another store nearby and told the manager the situation..I stated there the following week. That store became my home. My solace. A lonely strip mall store. I loved my regulars, i faught my way up to ASL and eventually (temp) SL. I loved my staff, I loved it. 

Fast forward to a new city. Four months in. I'm getting to know my regulars. There are families who love me because they aren't dollar signs to me. They are people. 

Ryan Cohen sucks balls. He doesn't give a single flip about our customers. About who makes this company money. We need to reverse a lot of these stupid changes. I've had people not get warranties, not renew pro because of this crap. 

Cohen isn't ""Power to the Players"" he's ""Pinch Pennies"". Things NEED to change or we will be blockbuster.

….Let me take you back to 2016……

It’s a 50% increase in trade day! They sent out an email this morning that we are doing a district contest! The team that gets the most procards today gets… nothing… but they do get an email shoutout! 

A family of 5 with 3 horribly behaved kids are running around while you take care of their gigantic blue bin from the 90s full of nasty treasures. From what you can see, there are off brand Wii remotes with no backs, a broken ps3 with no cords, 2 kinects, 360 cases with either no game or a scratched asf game that didn’t belong in that case, ps3 games worth 2 cents and like 2 ps4 FIFA games from 4 years ago the family expects boku bucks for since it’s for the new console. Great, they have skylanders too… time to get out the cheat sheet. *ten minutes later* Jackpot! They also have 2 3DS’s! (Sarcasm) One is without a serial number and has a partially broken screen with no stylus. The parents are mad at you when they find out they’re only getting 30 bucks for the other one that was not stollen at some point. OH and they can’t remember the password to the child lock they have on it. That’s nice, I’ll wait for them to call their older child who might know the code. 

You try to sell the procard to them since they’ll get more trade credit, but they won’t because they don’t want you to sell their information to 3rd parties

Best part: the parents are using Al this as trade in credit to get a PS4 and are expecting it for free.. nope, they’re getting like 80 bucks trade in. Then they and their 12 year old get into an argument in front of the counter because the parents are refusing to front any money towards the system to make up the difference. These wise parents are using this situation as a lesson on taking care of your things because apparently if the scratched last-gen-games were in good condition, they’d have made $170 more bucks. 

Meanwhile you are working a Saturday morning by yourself. You have a line of like 6. One is a regular that always likes to make misogynist jokes and then lingers for an hour after because you’re the only female that can’t tell him to fuck off. At least you can flirt with him to get GPGS. He also renews only with you. 😏 You also have a 360 trade in with a controller that has ALL the gunk on the sides and worn asf joysticks. You pretend you hate it but secretly live for getting the gunk out with the dental tools. Lastly you’ve got a 3DS trade that needs updating and the Wi-Fi is slow today. The guy has been waiting forever for this thing but he won’t take it home since he has no internet.(how???)

Finally the parents give in. They do NOT want insurance on the system… tbh I would actually recommend it in this case since we still cover water damage. 

They’re about to leave (yay) when the kid says they want GTA 5.  Then you have to give the talk about how you can buy a hooker, get a lap dance, and then sell her to cannibals… aka the 12 year old shouldn’t be playing it. The mom says the kid will play it at the Exs house anyway. No GPG for you either. So you get them the game and they finally hobble off, leaving their nasty blue bin behind with some random skylanders you don’t take and nasty candy stuck to the bottom.

First off, the website does t really have a lot for a selection. Unless you’re looking for gift cards. Oddly enough, if you want a GameStop gift card, you can only get $5, $10, $20, $150, and $200. (But every other gift card has all sorts of denominations.) but if I purchase something and I don’t have enough points I can just pay for it out of pocket. 

So just goofing around, I look through the electronics page and see an LG 86” class 80 series TV. It needs an insane amount of points but I use my measly 25k and just want to see what I would pay out of pocket for this TV. I would have to pay $5,406.60! So for 15 years of my life and $5k, I can get a brand new TV. Or I can just go to Best Buy and buy the exact same TV for $1599.99!

Such a slap in the face!! Why is this company so afraid to show appreciation for its employees? I refuse to believe there is that much of a disconnect between corporate and store level. Why is this company so afraid to show any sort of compassion or appreciation to the people who have helped keep this company alive for the past 5-10 years? Especially the last 2-3 years! And no, sending me a t-shirt with a rocket ship on it is not appreciation. It’s bandwagon BS. You force new managers to run multiple locations, while severely understaffed, cut our hours down to bare minimum, cut our ability for overtime, deny raises for SLs going on 4+ years now, (but we got stock options! Though we get taxed twice on those stocks, they have already lost 20%-25% of value, and we don’t have full access to the for 3 years.) How are we suppose to feel appreciated here?!?

I have been here for as long as I have, because I love what I do. I love my stores, my teams, my peers, and my guests. I credit this place for making me a better leader/mentor. I would not be who I am without these last 15years here. But GameStop doesn’t care about me. GameStop does not care about SLs, SL2s, ASLs, SGAs, and GAs. No one from corporate, DLs, RLs, no one cares. They just don’t. I have no faith that anyone knows what they are doing. There is no real direction and just seems like they are running this company by rolling some dice. At least with some companies, I would at least be a number. I’m not a number here, I’m just another drone pushing whatever agenda they are focusing on each week. 

Gamestop, you really need to reevaluate your priorities. Your business runs because of your stores. Start taking care of your stores. Start taking care of your associates!

All the policies they have changed in the past few months have legitimately made me stop selling and discourage people from getting warranties. I loved working here and my coworkers but ever since I came back In September I’ve seen every shred of a decent deal that GameStop have die. 2 years ago I worked 40 hrs this week from December 23rd to the 30th, and today I have been yelled at and treated terribly more than my past 4 years combined.

Me: No, sir. You’d have to purchase the battery pack and wire separately


Guest:  I don’t want to charge it, I want it wired.


Me: So, you want a wired controller?


Guest: But I want to use it wireless.


Me: Sir, the purpose of a wireless controller is to use it wirelessly, the wire gives you the ability to charge it while you’re playing.


Guest: So that’s only wireless, what about the wire? Can’t I take out the wire and still use it?

*about to cut off my ears with the box cutter* Me: Sir, all of the wired controllers require the wire for it to work.


- this continues to be a back and forth for a good 10 minutes -


During this, one if the senior guards in the mall looks at me and hears this convo as I proceed to put it on speaker and starts to die laughing on how we’re not coming to a general consensus of understanding what the fuck is happening.

this employee lost THREE systems because she went to the back and brought them out. (this was in december) the customers kept asking them to go grab more systems AND SHE DID. needless to say, three systems got snatched. 

flash forward to monday, she texts our groupchat (no. you're NOT supposed to message the groupchat about work related things.) saying that she can't close down the computers or count the safe due to ""circumstances out of her control""??? 

everyone else is beyond confused. it's 45 past the end of her shift. my sl and i get in today and immediately check the cameras to figure out what happened here. she had boxes EVERYWHERE. distro, rsbs, all over the place. over 3 hours she didn't fully complete a single box and just kept opening more. she also did not lock a single drawer. she handed a preordered item over without a transaction (luckily the item was fully paid off but that customer was actually owed a REFUND because of pro). and then, she starts a transaction for a system... grabs the binder, scans from it, goes to the back, grabs the system, AND SCANS THE SYSTEM AGAIN. she didn't cross out the system she sold and the book WAS RIGHT. there's just no excuse. anyways, i'm pulling my hair out over this one, it's just ridiculous at this point. she didn't call another store when she had issues with the computer, or our dm, or IT but claimed she did everything in her power to figure it out. she called myself and my sl six times each respectively. needless to say, she will probably be fired here soon. 

note: i know this is not due to a lack of corrective training on our end because another employee who received the same training under the poor excuse of an asl has been wonderful!

Time working: May 26, 1996 - May 25, 2006
Reason given: Changing time cards

Long story long, I worked for GameStop a year out of high school, back then it was Software Etc. After bugging management on and off for a year, the Store Manager gave me a shot right as he gave his two weeks notice. We started with a great team, even getting people later that year when Software Etc bought Babbages. Teams changed and I remained, hours were reduced and I remained. I actually left for Funcoland and right after, GS bought them and all my seniority still stuck and I was back working both stores. With less hours meant me getting 2nd and 3rd jobs to make bills, so a majority of my management experience actually came from outside GS while I still worked there part time one day a week. 

I heard Electronics Boutique was opening a store so I threw my hat into the ring and got the job. Which also...shortly after EB was bought by GS, so yeah...back into the fold. 

I had a fantastic team, we were top in our district and topped out the region in the upper ranks. Then...they changed our DM to a GS DM and reorganized. Questions I had that were no issue for my previous DM were bothersome to the new one. 

Let me preface this by the fact that the store was 37 miles (in a row!?) from where I lived. Getting to the store was never a traffic thing, it was just distance. 

If anyone knows the old systems they also take a good 7-8 minutes to boot up before you can actually login.

So I'd arrive on time, switch things on, change out the security tapes, and when it was 8 min past id adjust my time to being correct, no worries. If it was 7 min I didn't need to do anything. I didn't have any concerns since my team knew I was good for it and the security footage always showed me on time. 

So the merger went through end of 2005. Something I wasn't aware of was that they were tracking my adjustments starting that January...but they didn't say ""hey, we notice something's up, care to explain?"" You know, nip it in the bud. Instead they kept tracking it for 5 months straight. After asking my ASM, they promised him the store if he didn't say anything, they promptly showed up a day before my 10 years and let me go.

They said I should have had my assistant change the times, which, had they said something, I wouldn't have had a problem with that. I offered for the to review the tapes to prove what I was doing was an issue and they refused. So I was done.

Later they even added up all those 15 min changes and tried to call me and say I was responsible to pay that back to which I stated they only paid me for 40 hours a week, but if they'd like, I could add up all the extra hours I'd worked over that and give them a bill as well. 

Truth be told, I saw how other store were getting rid of EB managers and replacing them with GS staff. I actually started a new job at Verizon Wireless the following week that I was waiting to hear back from when let go anyways.

Fast forward a year and the store manager that worked his way up from SA at my original store came in to see if he could get a discount on his Verizon bill. Mind you GS was still owned by the CEO of Barnes and Nobles at the time so their discount applied. 

To apply a discount I just needed a paystub. This guy who killed himself to be where he was, and was even on track for a DM role was making $15.87/hour. I was let go making over $16 over a year before. My ASM was over $12.50 and my 3rd key I got $9+.

If it was 7 min I didn&#39;t need to do anything. I didn&#39;t have any concerns since my team knew I was good for it and the security footage always showed me on time. </p>

<p>So the merger went through end of 2005. Something I wasn&#39;t aware of was that they were tracking my adjustments starting that January...but they didn&#39;t say &quot;hey, we notice something&#39;s up, care to explain?&quot; You know, nip it in the bud. Instead they kept tracking it for 5 months straight. After asking my ASM, they promised him the store if he didn&#39;t say anything, they promptly showed up a day before my 10 years and let me go.</p>

<p>They said I should have had my assistant change the times, which, had they said something, I wouldn&#39;t have had a problem with that. I offered for the to review the tapes to prove what I was doing was an issue and they refused. So I was done.</p>

<p>Later they even added up all those 15 min changes and tried to call me and say I was responsible to pay that back to which I stated they only paid me for 40 hours a week, but if they&#39;d like, I could add up all the extra hours I&#39;d worked over that and give them a bill as well. </p>

<p>Truth be told, I saw how other store were getting rid of EB managers and replacing them with GS staff. I actually started a new job at Verizon Wireless the following week that I was waiting to hear back from when let go anyways.</p>

<p>Fast forward a year and the store manager that worked his way up from SA at my original store came in to see if he could get a discount on his Verizon bill. Mind you GS was still owned by the CEO of Barnes and Nobles at the time so their discount applied. </p>

<p>To apply a discount I just needed a paystub. This guy who killed himself to be where he was, and was even on track for a DM role was making $15.87/hour. I was let go making over $16 over a year before. My ASM was over $12.50 and my 3rd key I got $9+. </p>

<p>It was never about the timecards, it was about cutting down staff to replace with cheaper staff.</p>

This  move will require developers of third-party applications to pay enormous  sums of money if they wish to stay functional, meaning that said  applications (which include browsers like Reddit Is Fun, Apollo, and  Relay for Reddit) will be effectively destroyed. In the short term, this  may give Reddit the appearance of being more profitable than it truly  is... but in the long term, it will undermine the platform as a whole.

Reddit  relies on volunteer moderators to keep the platform welcoming and free  of objectionable material. It also relies on uncompensated contributors  to keep its numerous communities populated. The above decision promises  to adversely impact both groups: Without effective tools, moderators  cannot combat spammers, bad actors, or the entities who enable either;  without the freedom to choose how and where they access Reddit, many  contributors will simply leave. Rather than hosting creativity and  in-depth discourse, the platform will soon feature only recycled  content, bot-driven activity, and an ever-dwindling number of  well-informed visitors. The very elements which differentiate Reddit –  the fixtures which make it appealing – will be eliminated.

We  implore Reddit to listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its  everyday users; to the people whose activity has allowed the platform to  exist at all: Do not sacrifice long-term viability for the sake of a  short-lived illusion. Do not tacitly enable bad actors by working  against your volunteers. Do not aim solely at your looming IPO while  giving no thought to what may come afterward. If Steve Huffman's  statement – ""I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our  shareholders to be users"" – is to be taken seriously, then please  consider this our vote:

<p>We  implore Reddit to listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its  everyday users; to the people whose activity has allowed the platform to  exist at all: Do not sacrifice long-term viability for the sake of a  short-lived illusion. Do not tacitly enable bad actors by working  against your volunteers. Do not aim solely at your looming IPO while  giving no thought to what may come afterward. If Steve Huffman&#39;s  statement – &quot;I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our  shareholders to be users&quot; – is to be taken seriously, then please  consider this our vote:</p>

<p>Allow the developers of third-party applications to affordably retain their productive (and vital) API access.</p>

<p>Allow Reddit and Redditors to thrive.</p>
