235,1684587581.0,i think i just hit my final straw so yesterday was one of the scariest days of my life to give a bit of backstory theres a guy who around a month ago came in he never said a word and just stared at me from afar but i could see an upside down cross tattoo on his forehead that was the most notable part of his appearance he had this sick grin on his face and while i was helping girls get their cash for their system he bolted up to us cut the girls off and got in my face he was breathing really heavy and was shaking but never said a word my assistant is a guy and he got in between us he asked the man if he was okay and the guy looked at him then left the next day i was off and my assistant was working the scary guy came back in again but this time with a ski mask on and asked for me directly my asm said i wasnt in and then called him out for being the guy from yesterday the guy said you know too much and left i bought pepper spray and always watched my surroundings seeing as my store is in kind of a shady area but yesterday was the cherry on top i was training a new hire and was in to close with her the night started fine as we were working on trades she was learning to ring people out on her own it was fun but then when the store was empty he walked in again and as soon as we saw each other he had that same sick grin he never took his eyes off of me until he grabbed a pack of cards he asked the new hire how much they were and she said when she rang them up they came out to he got mad and started speaking threateningly saying we need to learn a lesson about honesty that if we arent careful someone could teach it to us at this point i cant breathe im so scared i call one of my associates because i didnt wanna anger him with me calling the cops i know it might sound dumb but i was terrified i had no idea what to do i called him he lives down the street and has phones he was at my other store i knew he could call the cops without me looking suspicious to the guy i kept my associate on the phone discussing things on main menu then the guy made his way over to me he put another card pack in front of me and got close to my face i started to ring him up and his total was i told him and he chuckled and opened his pants waist to show me something this wasnt the first time he tried to make me look in his pants i couldnt really see nor did i want to but he kept asking how much it was and was getting more and more angry when the price never changed he reached in his pants and began shaking like he was getting nervous my associate was about to call the police and i think he could tell he started to leave but my newhire said wait dont forget your bag and he turned around grabbed his bag of cards he had purchased and left on the counter not the one i rang up and then got in my face one last time and said why didnt you say anything what are you trying to pull dont tempt me and then left as soon as he left i broke out sobbing i locked the door called the police and pulled up dvr footage they later found the guy and he admitted to having an obsession with me he also said he was kicked out of his house for hostility due to him not taking his meds for his schizophrenia my mom works in a law firm and has for my entire life shes seen this kind of behavior its a fine line and i am terrified to work at that store alone the cops said hes banned yea but what will that really do to stop him my associates and i think hes trying to build up the courage to do something to me so ive told my dm i cannot work at that store alone for the next few weeks im too afraid and she said she cant accommodate that and this is part of the job sometimes that ill be fine she said the same thing the last time i begged to be able to call the police when the guy came in with a ski mask on looking for me im done im done with this company im years old and i have my entire life ahead of me someone from another store in my district reported that he had a gun pulled on him at my store before i became the sl to it im not doing this once i find a new job im quitting it was a fun run while it lasted,0.9956576173426583,0.0,0.4259715676307678

224,1685976345.0,guest interaction guest came in from another store to return his zelda game and then get that back in cash i asked them if they had a receipt they said no i asked them no problem do you have a phone number with gamestop they said no i said well why dont we try it anyways and sure enough they do not therefore there is no proof of purchase they did not want anything in the store if it was store credit i would have made an exception they wanted cash back i explained to them since we could not prove that they purchased the game at gamestop there was no way i could give them a refund and since the game is so new its not eligible for trade either they asked me if i could look up the transaction with their credit card and i said no theres not a way for me to enter credit card information then they proceeded to ask if they can show me their bank statements i said that on bank statements it would state how much the total is and then the company and while the total might match theres no way to prove that they bought this specific game and thats not proof of purchase because i felt like i was shutting them down i told them that if they wanted to go back to the location that they bought it at they might get lucky and the person who run them up might be there and remember them and would do the return for them they said that they didnt want to do that because theyve been driving and why cant i just do it for them i inform them that this is policy and if i had rung them up this would be a different story as i would have likely remembered them therefore could confirm proof of purchase the guest then asked if they could speak to my manager i inform them that i am the assistant store lead they rolled their eyes told me that nobody wants to work in this day and age and that i was very rude i am probably one of the nicest people that you will ever find working at a gamestop i know about a third of my customers by name and maybe another third just by face i will not apologize for following policy especially when i was given attitude throughout the entire interaction if a guest wants an exception made to policy they really have to be nice because im not getting in trouble for somebody who is rude giving me attitude and also swearing at me in front of their child i am happy to make exceptions especially if they wanted store credit or to buy something else in the store and maybe get the difference back but i will not be verbally abused and then make an exception to policy that may get me in trouble later thats not how this works,0.99928363692743,0.0,-0.49510185420513153

82,1687037685.0,i had quit today i was really really sad that i had quit my job at gamestop as a part time sga i havent quit a job in a long time because ive never been a quitter im as persistent and stubborn as my mom lol i was good at making sales and hit quotas most of the time before our store went back to its old hours some of the time i couldnt even make slightly perfect quotas with just working two hours for my recent shifts but hey i accepted it because i was the new guy i loved my team the work culture especially the benefits and waking up to tell our customers how exciting gaming is and assisting them in whatever they needed but it had got to a point where i felt a weird vibe with my store manager first time was when i was doing the closing procedure for the first time and couldnt really wrap my head around with keys on the keyboard i need to press and i called my manager he told me what was needed to be done and i messed up closing the registers so he told me press f you whore and i was like ok because he is my boss and ive never had a boss that said that to me so i chuckled a bit because that language was new territory in my past job experiences ive always felt respected and reassured when i have someone there to let me do hands on training after that experience i didnt really take it personally because its job and i always appreciated his assistance in helping me with any problem because i know he means well and i like to think that hes a awesome guy but my latest experience left me mentally scarred a bit i was doing the closing procedure again and this time i had to handle the deposit situation with all the midday cash drops so doing that was new territory so i did everything by memory and im happy that this time i was able to get things done before my shift was over and after we closed the store without any assistance so i was very proud of the milestone that i accomplished i was doing the deposit and filling out the discrepancy on the main register when the amount was a little off i called my boss and relayed him that situation and he asked if i had counted the cash drops as well and i told no he then stated this exact thing oh my fucking god are you serious and do not give me another excuse of that you didnt know i told him well if i cant say that then i dont know what else to say he told me to count it with the deposit and go home and i told him exactly ok i dont speak ill of a person because i wish to only spread happiness and kindness to other people plus in my past job experience i was taught that you need to respect authority even if things are not exactly perfect but i was on the verge of crying but i told myself dont take it personally because its ok i added the amount of the cash drops but physically still had the deposit separated from that because i thought thats what i shouldve did i mean this is new territory so i did my best with what was given to me and thats that after closing the store altogether and clocking out like i always do i decided to call him and tell him that from my side of things i havent had a closing shift that dealt with cash drops so my apologies for not giving it my all and he told me that even if i wasnt taught that that its common sense and if i called him to talk only about that then i was wasting time and that he wish to not talk about that any further i held back my tears and anything negative i thought and just said ok thats perfectly fine i needed someone to talk to about this so i called up my mom and also my good mother role model that lives in california and they both acknowledged what i had to say and really agreed on getting you a job that values you as a person and they told me that im worth more than being treated then that so that recharged my confidence i told my boss on my next closing shift on the day that he was working and told me thanks for this opportunity give him my keys and name tag and rode home playing my favorite doja cat songs to let myself know that i love myself and that im the best thing since sliced bread and any job will be appreciated to have me,0.48709601163864136,0.0,0.17533817887306213

69,1690465747.0,if you cant technology just stop please need a place to scream at the void here warning lots of reading here scroll to the bottom for tldr im a helpful person sometimes too helpful now this is where my patience gets tested child visits grandparent as a guardian when mother isnt available they live in different neighboring states the grandparent is giving their child the ability to play some games okay its fortnite and roblox kids loves these games they both come into the store as normal customers and the kid wants some currency for both games cool this is normal i ring them out as usual they got a membership too sweet gave them their receipt with the cards and off they go with their day normal interaction per usual id expect they know how to redeem these cards dead wrong here about an hour later they called saying they dont know how to redeem the codes and asking me if theyre activated i told them yes and there should be instructions in the back of the card as well as tell them that checking out either robloxs website or watch youtube videos as a tutorial same with fortnite they said ok well do that thought that was the end after the conversation on the phone you know where this is going nope the grandparent and child came back to the store with the childs tablet and tells me its not working aka they didnt do anything but i try to help its a slow day slow paced store so i got time now the problems here start to overlay first roblox i have very little knowledge with this app so navigation is a slight learning curve problem grandparent and child does not know the login information for their own roblox account the mother set the information up with making their child an email address child was too young to understand how logins work so the grandparent had to call mother that didnt answer the phone to find information on how to gain access to the childs email account with no prevail the grandparent looks at me saying so how do i do this then internal facepalm apparently redeeming a roblox code isnt done through the app but through the website browser that took about minutes to figure that out now we just have to login through the web browser to redeem the code ok i look through my phone to see if google has a answer apparently there was another way to navigate though this process upon research you can access the account via time code setup problem time code setup gets sent to the email now the problem is where did it get sent to because there was an parental email setup now she had to call like people on who set this one up turns out they put it on the grandparents email address and you know what happens next i cant login to my email i dont know the password intenal reaction gdi thank gawd her email password reset verification is only though her phone via sms so we reset that password then get the code to access roblox and then we entered the roblox code in the account now funds are there problem this was a short fix converting the currency to robux had to google that one too now onto fortnite same problems different game they dont know the login information and also had to setup a parental account for epic games since the child had restricted access to enter fortnite codes so i had to do a step by step setup for her account so they can redeem fortnite currency fortnite is a little more tame but at this point im so internally frustrated it went as far as reinstalling the entire game because something got messed up from probably what the kid did before coming into the store that was another hours they were in store for about hours and then another hour after the installation thankfully they were patient i helped guests inbetween and answered the usual phone calls as they waited all tasks were done beforehand so its just helping the guests feel bad for the child must of been bored out of his mind trying to get his stuff fixed finally all of that is fixed after forever something time passes theyre good to go both cards are redeemed and the child can do what he wants to buy stuff on there week later grandparent calls complaining they need a verification code because the mother and child was trying to redeem points for an online purchase i told her i dont have access to that thats something thats emailed to you i deleted it i told her she can recover that in the trash folder in the email surprised surprised she didnt know how to find that i even told her that they can hit a button on the same page to resend verification they cant find it told them they can redo the process but concerned that its the same code in the trash and thought the new email will go in the email trash at this point i told her to tell the mother and child to go into their nearby gamestop store and have the rep assist them she tried to tell me that it may be better to have her call me to help them out at a different gamestop when theyre there i just said ill try end of conversation why is the grandparent doing all the work for this child who doesnt know much about technology and the mother is just not helping at all why cant the grandparent communicate with the mother to see if they have all the information needed just incase these things happen write all of this down how do you not know your passwords for all of your accounts make notes somewhere so you dont forget why even bother with all of this if no one is technology literate tldr seriously just tell the child that hes not old enough and let him do something else no point for them to go through all of this just to buy some cosmetics n stuff that will last him like days or just dont buy anything for him on these games if its too hard dont attempt sure technology is hard for people dont pop a vein and sanity for these
