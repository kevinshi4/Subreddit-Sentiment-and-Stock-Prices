235,1684587581.0,i think i just hit my final straw so yesterday was one of the scariest days of my life to give a bit of backstory theres a guy who around a month ago came in he never said a word and just stared at me from afar but i could see an upside down cross tattoo on his forehead that was the most notable part of his appearance he had this sick grin on his face and while i was helping girls get their cash for their system he bolted up to us cut the girls off and got in my face he was breathing really heavy and was shaking but never said a word my assistant is a guy and he got in between us he asked the man if he was okay and the guy looked at him then left the next day i was off and my assistant was working the scary guy came back in again but this time with a ski mask on and asked for me directly my asm said i wasnt in and then called him out for being the guy from yesterday the guy said you know too much and left i bought pepper spray and always watched my surroundings seeing as my store is in kind of a shady area but yesterday was the cherry on top i was training a new hire and was in to close with her the night started fine as we were working on trades she was learning to ring people out on her own it was fun but then when the store was empty he walked in again and as soon as we saw each other he had that same sick grin he never took his eyes off of me until he grabbed a pack of cards he asked the new hire how much they were and she said when she rang them up they came out to he got mad and started speaking threateningly saying we need to learn a lesson about honesty that if we arent careful someone could teach it to us at this point i cant breathe im so scared i call one of my associates because i didnt wanna anger him with me calling the cops i know it might sound dumb but i was terrified i had no idea what to do i called him he lives down the street and has phones he was at my other store i knew he could call the cops without me looking suspicious to the guy i kept my associate on the phone discussing things on main menu then the guy made his way over to me he put another card pack in front of me and got close to my face i started to ring him up and his total was i told him and he chuckled and opened his pants waist to show me something this wasnt the first time he tried to make me look in his pants i couldnt really see nor did i want to but he kept asking how much it was and was getting more and more angry when the price never changed he reached in his pants and began shaking like he was getting nervous my associate was about to call the police and i think he could tell he started to leave but my newhire said wait dont forget your bag and he turned around grabbed his bag of cards he had purchased and left on the counter not the one i rang up and then got in my face one last time and said why didnt you say anything what are you trying to pull dont tempt me and then left as soon as he left i broke out sobbing i locked the door called the police and pulled up dvr footage they later found the guy and he admitted to having an obsession with me he also said he was kicked out of his house for hostility due to him not taking his meds for his schizophrenia my mom works in a law firm and has for my entire life shes seen this kind of behavior its a fine line and i am terrified to work at that store alone the cops said hes banned yea but what will that really do to stop him my associates and i think hes trying to build up the courage to do something to me so ive told my dm i cannot work at that store alone for the next few weeks im too afraid and she said she cant accommodate that and this is part of the job sometimes that ill be fine she said the same thing the last time i begged to be able to call the police when the guy came in with a ski mask on looking for me im done im done with this company im years old and i have my entire life ahead of me someone from another store in my district reported that he had a gun pulled on him at my store before i became the sl to it im not doing this once i find a new job im quitting it was a fun run while it lasted

224,1685976345.0,guest interaction guest came in from another store to return his zelda game and then get that back in cash i asked them if they had a receipt they said no i asked them no problem do you have a phone number with gamestop they said no i said well why dont we try it anyways and sure enough they do not therefore there is no proof of purchase they did not want anything in the store if it was store credit i would have made an exception they wanted cash back i explained to them since we could not prove that they purchased the game at gamestop there was no way i could give them a refund and since the game is so new its not eligible for trade either they asked me if i could look up the transaction with their credit card and i said no theres not a way for me to enter credit card information then they proceeded to ask if they can show me their bank statements i said that on bank statements it would state how much the total is and then the company and while the total might match theres no way to prove that they bought this specific game and thats not proof of purchase because i felt like i was shutting them down i told them that if they wanted to go back to the location that they bought it at they might get lucky and the person who run them up might be there and remember them and would do the return for them they said that they didnt want to do that because theyve been driving and why cant i just do it for them i inform them that this is policy and if i had rung them up this would be a different story as i would have likely remembered them therefore could confirm proof of purchase the guest then asked if they could speak to my manager i inform them that i am the assistant store lead they rolled their eyes told me that nobody wants to work in this day and age and that i was very rude i am probably one of the nicest people that you will ever find working at a gamestop i know about a third of my customers by name and maybe another third just by face i will not apologize for following policy especially when i was given attitude throughout the entire interaction if a guest wants an exception made to policy they really have to be nice because im not getting in trouble for somebody who is rude giving me attitude and also swearing at me in front of their child i am happy to make exceptions especially if they wanted store credit or to buy something else in the store and maybe get the difference back but i will not be verbally abused and then make an exception to policy that may get me in trouble later thats not how this works

113,1696482411.0,my store got robbed i wanted to share a crazy experience i had during my shift at gamestop recently i am still so pissed about this happening and very disappointed i didnt catch him in the act around midafternoon a man walked in with his adorable yearold kid in tow at first everything seemed normal he was polite and charming striking up a conversation about the latest gaming releases little did i know this was all part of an elaborate distraction as i was busy chatting with him about the spiderman ps he skillfully maneuvered his toddler around the store keeping our attention divided you know how kids are at gamestop touching moving around and throwing everything i had another associate with me and we were pretty busy at the time honestly he definitely waited until we were busy to pull this off thats when it happened the dude swiftly ripped the ps xbox controllers off of the magnetic peg hooks and stashed them into a bag he had brought with him our store is usually low traction so we keep multiples of each kind of controller on display also customers bring bookbags in all the time at my store i honestly didnt think too much about it i still have no clue how he did this because i feel like we wouldve been able to hear it it wasnt until my other coworker got a phone call from another store that a guy also robbed them of their controllers with his kid we were in absolute shock and disbelief we literally had no clue that they were doing it obviously by the time we got the call it was too late also he was visibly armed lol so there wasnt really anything we could do bc no way in hell i am risking my life for gamestop i immediately called the police the second he left which took them minutes to show up it was a surreal experience and i cant believe how smoothly he pulled it off using his child as a distraction

114,1688352524.0,i dont think gamestop is as dead as people make it out to be terrible corporate decisions aside i think the whole meme behind is gamestop still a thing is taken more seriously than it should be the store i work at still generates a ton of traffic and believe it or not theres still a relatively huge demand for physical copies of pre owned games especially from nintendo fans obviously its not mandatory anymore and the collectiblestoys that toys r us can no longer provide boosts a lot too which makes our store not much less busy than other retailers i also know it depends hugely on location what has your guys experience been me personally i believe that if gamestop does inevitably shut down then the store i work at is probably gonna turn into some funko distributorpop culture retailer very similar to what it is now

113,1703893479.0,after ten years tomorrow is a new day turned over my keys to a new manager today packed up my coffee maker and my emotional support vault boy and left for the last time i missed gamestop before i even walked out the door ive missed gamestop for a long time the place we used to be back when midnight launches were a real party when it wasnt unheard of to get reserves on an annual title when the customers were actually happy to come into the store when we had a minimum of hours to go around every week and when our holiday schedules were two pages full of people back when seasonals were actually necessary and all stores had an assistant manager instead of just getting one as a gold star reward for being shafted by the resurrection of the sl program back when vegas conference was so big that it felt like it took half an hour to walk across the breakfast hall and three times that to get back to your room at the end of the day back in the days where gamestop actually meant something to the gaming industry at large instead of the jokefootnote it has become my employees brought me to tears today i tried to hold it together but i ugly cried when i got into the car everyone showed up even the ones that werent scheduled gave me a gift card to a local place and told me to take my spouse on a date told me to not be a stranger and that maybe we can be friends now that im not their boss one wrote a note thanking me for giving them a chance and believing in them which im going to keep forever as a reminder that ive made a positive impact ive told them all for months even before i put in my notice that id always have their backs that if they were trying to leave they didnt need to worry about telling me because they deserved better than gamestop was willing to give and that id always give them a glowing recommendation now that im gone theyve still got me to put down as a reference but now theyve also got my gamertag now so we can all play some baldurs gate together i wouldnt have been able to keep things running without their support and i will be eternally grateful to them im going to miss all of my employees and most of my colleagues im even going to miss my dm because theyre the only boss ive ever had who never once failed me any time they said trust me ive got you they did their best to help us navigate all of these awful changes from corporate and boss i know youre probably reading this so just so you know we can all tell you hate these changes as much as we do even though you cant say it to corporate i see what youre doing the writing is on the wall for anyone who cares to look failing stocks in lieu of raises removing overtime aka paycuts slashing benefits slashing payroll bringing back the failed sl program those four weekly hours of overtime are what you gave us when we switched from salary in order to match our salary pay how many tenured managers are now making less today than they were seven years ago im genuinely disgusted to my peers know your worth and truly understand the skills that youve cultivated in your time here i know there arent too many left with years but that time is enough to negate most bachelors degree requirements for a office job once you take the time to write a good resume for those of you who are newer which i definitely saw at conference learn all you can hone your skills and run as soon as you get a chance at a better opportunity i dont think im ever going to be in another working environment where i feel half as much support as ive gotten from my peers or where i am so genuinely encouraged to be myself ive got so many memories both good and bad ive made friends that i will treasure forever ive gained confidence in my own abilities that i dont think i could have cultivated without the support of the person who hired me and the team i surrounded myself with but now the network is down for the last time dont send any customers my way

110,1699653958.0,the end is nigh but you can enjoy the time you have left edit i was unsure what type of reaction i would get to this post but i certainly didnt have brigaded by stonkers on my bingo card oh well the bad news based on the memos and costcutting changes coming from lord dog food i have to say that its looking like hes positioning the company to file for bankruptcy there are different types of bankruptcy but the terms are more favorable if youre able to demonstrate that youve taken duediligence measures to cut costs before you file that is the reason for the recent customerrepellent changes such as downgraded pro perks and the new warranty policy this is about making sure the csuites golden parachute is solid gold its not about saving the company while im going to sorely miss being able to visit gamestop when i go to the mall with my family its a business that simply doesnt make sense anymore financially so please understand killing yourselves to hit the numbers that corporate is demanding of you is not going to save your job nothing will the good news you essentially have nothing to lose strip away the ridiculous demands from corporate and you are working a job that a lot of us dreamed of growing up your days are numbered so why not make this job what it should have been all along heres my recommendation dos do continue to help customers make the best purchase decisions for themselves and their children there are asshole customers but to most folks you are video game experts enjoy that to its greatest extent i remember working at babbages in the s and stopping a mom from buying an n for her son by asking her what his friends play playstation having been the only kid in my town with an atari i still feel great about probably making that kids christmas do stay out of jail although the company is a sinking ship if the checks and balances dont add up they can still bring you to court so no super special discounts or anything donts dont stress out over metrics gs is already working with a skeleton crew at each location they can hem and haw all day but they need at least person who actually knows the systems and processes at each location youre not going to get fired until theyre ready to shut down the store dont pitch warranties you dont believe in use your judgement about whether or not a warranty will truly be worth it for a given customer dont kill yourself over preorders if you think something might be difficult to get ahold of without preordering and you feel confident that gs can acquire adequate stock to cover preorders on that item then fine otherwise no dont take trades you dont want to someone brings in an xbone thats sticky or smells of smoke tell them to sell it on ebay corporate likes to tell you to think like an owner heres a perfect opportunity to do so tldr gamestop is going to close if you work there and love games try to just enjoy the time you have left by running your store the way you want to let corporate whine and cry all they want they have nothing to offer you for playing their game

108,1699088635.0,thank you for the transparency in this sub i went into my gamestop on monday to use my monthly discount on a playstation card associate informed me that my membership expired on and asked if i wanted to renew i politely declined mainly because i like to fully research things before signing up especially true after all the negative pro changes in the past year as part of the research i visited this sub and learned of the lastest horrors corporate is throwing at you and the customer quickly decided the plan and frankly gamestop was no longer fit for my business went in today to make sure i used my final benefit on another playstation card associate saw my membership expired tomorrow and put on the hard sell me no thank you associate are you sure youll lose your monthly coupon if you dont sign up again me no thank you associate youve saved money because of your membership are you sure youd be throwing away free money why dont you want to renew me i dont approve of the changes to the pro plan in the past year specifically not being able to use the coupon on currency cards next month i also dont like that i can no longer use the gift cards i get for trading in on currency either associate they might change the posa again just like they did last time and not being able to use gift cards to get digital currency isnt just a gamestop thing the vendors are restricting that its the same policy that walmart and best buy have even if those go away though youll still get the trade bonus and extra percent off on all your purchases are you sure you dont want to renew me i will not be renewing at this point the associate finally finalized the purchase so i could input my card and compete the transaction thank to this sub for spreading the information about pro so consumers could make an honest and informed choice there is no way in hell gamestop was going to tell me that and apparently neither was the associate it felt so shady for them to still push and try and refute me when i was trying to be so truthful i wish there were still customer surveys so i could provide feedback the last time i contacted general customer support about an instore interaction it took me three weeks to get a standard form response no idea if it ever went to the district manager

102,1701750210.0,i think i know how gamestop keeps going my theory now on how gamestop has survived for so long in spite of itself is because its clientele includes people that are just shockingly stupid one time i had a guy come to my store from miles away even though there were gamestops closer to where he lived he was trying to trade in his xbox one and about games for a nintendo switch oled or swish outlet as he called it and mortal kombat one he did no research into how much it would cost and it turned out he didnt even have enough money to cover the difference he switched gears and then asked for a playstation with mortal kombat which was one of the games he was trading in for xbox one i told him he was making a terrible decision and i think on some level he realized this but didnt want his trip to be for nothing i finally talked him into buying a preowned switch version with mortal kombat one which he could afford i am amazed this guy even found the door to get out of his house let alone make it to my store from where he said he did

87,1694565300.0,we have to check id regardless if you look old or not do not get mad please long explanation but the summary of it is that at our location we are required to always check id even if they are of age because of two main reason our location being in a busy shopping center and past issues we have had specifically children not telling their parents what the game is now idk if its the same for every district or every store probably not but that is what we we are told to do now i myself always found this new change odd and a bit exaggerating to say the least but after my manager and my dm spoken to us the team about it and why we push for this policy from here on out i guess in the end it all make sense tbh i dont mind it and dont care much about it as long as we make the sale its all good now we been doing this ever since the year before covid since holiday season i will say and i guess i was dumb enough to hope that people will understand but nope times i been yelled at by guests as to why i need to check id i would calmly explain to them why and what the rating system is but they would say along the lines of but i played or is just blood and gore or dont i look old enough im literally years old sorry but i am told to check id regardless reason why i share this is because a guy came in looking for black ops looked about ish or so years asked for his id and he lost it when i said i cant ring him up for it unfortunately he almost was about to yell at me until i told him im really sorry but im following procedures that my dm is telling me he ofc calmed down but still called me a btch and walked off which i have already gone use to myself and i dont mind if i am thrown insults at once and while but i ask that guests dont do it to none of my other coworkers they are all doing the same procedures i am doing

82,1687037685.0,i had quit today i was really really sad that i had quit my job at gamestop as a part time sga i havent quit a job in a long time because ive never been a quitter im as persistent and stubborn as my mom lol i was good at making sales and hit quotas most of the time before our store went back to its old hours some of the time i couldnt even make slightly perfect quotas with just working two hours for my recent shifts but hey i accepted it because i was the new guy i loved my team the work culture especially the benefits and waking up to tell our customers how exciting gaming is and assisting them in whatever they needed but it had got to a point where i felt a weird vibe with my store manager first time was when i was doing the closing procedure for the first time and couldnt really wrap my head around with keys on the keyboard i need to press and i called my manager he told me what was needed to be done and i messed up closing the registers so he told me press f you whore and i was like ok because he is my boss and ive never had a boss that said that to me so i chuckled a bit because that language was new territory in my past job experiences ive always felt respected and reassured when i have someone there to let me do hands on training after that experience i didnt really take it personally because its job and i always appreciated his assistance in helping me with any problem because i know he means well and i like to think that hes a awesome guy but my latest experience left me mentally scarred a bit i was doing the closing procedure again and this time i had to handle the deposit situation with all the midday cash drops so doing that was new territory so i did everything by memory and im happy that this time i was able to get things done before my shift was over and after we closed the store without any assistance so i was very proud of the milestone that i accomplished i was doing the deposit and filling out the discrepancy on the main register when the amount was a little off i called my boss and relayed him that situation and he asked if i had counted the cash drops as well and i told no he then stated this exact thing oh my fucking god are you serious and do not give me another excuse of that you didnt know i told him well if i cant say that then i dont know what else to say he told me to count it with the deposit and go home and i told him exactly ok i dont speak ill of a person because i wish to only spread happiness and kindness to other people plus in my past job experience i was taught that you need to respect authority even if things are not exactly perfect but i was on the verge of crying but i told myself dont take it personally because its ok i added the amount of the cash drops but physically still had the deposit separated from that because i thought thats what i shouldve did i mean this is new territory so i did my best with what was given to me and thats that after closing the store altogether and clocking out like i always do i decided to call him and tell him that from my side of things i havent had a closing shift that dealt with cash drops so my apologies for not giving it my all and he told me that even if i wasnt taught that that its common sense and if i called him to talk only about that then i was wasting time and that he wish to not talk about that any further i held back my tears and anything negative i thought and just said ok thats perfectly fine i needed someone to talk to about this so i called up my mom and also my good mother role model that lives in california and they both acknowledged what i had to say and really agreed on getting you a job that values you as a person and they told me that im worth more than being treated then that so that recharged my confidence i told my boss on my next closing shift on the day that he was working and told me thanks for this opportunity give him my keys and name tag and rode home playing my favorite doja cat songs to let myself know that i love myself and that im the best thing since sliced bread and any job will be appreciated to have me

69,1691603435.0,who do you think complains about doing their job more starbucks employees or fedex drivers so over the course of my years here i always notice a few fedex employees dropping boxes off and then getting physically pissed off when i tell them we have stuff going out for you and before i tell this story let me just state that at our store and others ive talked with employees with we have the fedex drivers take the distro in the back room unless its something small like a bag or a small box well the other day i had one of the fedex express drivers come by and he was dropping off console boxes of pss he comes in and takes them to the back of the store and sets the boxes in front of the backroom with a store filled with customers and im by myself helping a line of people so i ask him would you mind setting those in the back room for me please thank you not condescending or anything ive never had an issue with this guy before but he looks at me from across the store we are a small store with visible anger like if i just called his mother a slur and the proceeded to take them in the back which was literally maybe not even extra feet from where he originally tried setting them then he come up to me so i can sign for the dropping off and he says you want me to come back and stock them for you as well then snatched the scanner out of my hand like god forbid i dont want dollars of merchandise stolen while im busy

71,1681969293.0,no sale without pro membership i tried to buy a ps today but the employee told me they would only sell it to me with an active pro membership and that it was specifically instructed by corporate so i went to target next door and bought the ragnarok bundle instead is anyone else experiencing this i was also told that any hardware i buy cannot be returned under any circumstance once purchased which was even more shady updateedit theres a lot of replies so ill just try to do a catch all response i spent the extra money for the bundle at target because it was a gift for someone and i needed another game and bought it a little out of spite i told the employee that the rule is silly and i dont want to pay the since id never use the benefits again she immediately went into a brace for angry customer mode but i reassured her im not mad at her at all just annoyed that gs is having her enforce a dumb policy i will leave a review on the store location because its not fair to younger people specifically they may not know pss are more available and if they see one for the first time in gs they might try to instantly buy it and get hit with the paywall by surprise just feels wrong and inequitable to slide some money to gs for access to buy it

69,1690465747.0,if you cant technology just stop please need a place to scream at the void here warning lots of reading here scroll to the bottom for tldr im a helpful person sometimes too helpful now this is where my patience gets tested child visits grandparent as a guardian when mother isnt available they live in different neighboring states the grandparent is giving their child the ability to play some games okay its fortnite and roblox kids loves these games they both come into the store as normal customers and the kid wants some currency for both games cool this is normal i ring them out as usual they got a membership too sweet gave them their receipt with the cards and off they go with their day normal interaction per usual id expect they know how to redeem these cards dead wrong here about an hour later they called saying they dont know how to redeem the codes and asking me if theyre activated i told them yes and there should be instructions in the back of the card as well as tell them that checking out either robloxs website or watch youtube videos as a tutorial same with fortnite they said ok well do that thought that was the end after the conversation on the phone you know where this is going nope the grandparent and child came back to the store with the childs tablet and tells me its not working aka they didnt do anything but i try to help its a slow day slow paced store so i got time now the problems here start to overlay first roblox i have very little knowledge with this app so navigation is a slight learning curve problem grandparent and child does not know the login information for their own roblox account the mother set the information up with making their child an email address child was too young to understand how logins work so the grandparent had to call mother that didnt answer the phone to find information on how to gain access to the childs email account with no prevail the grandparent looks at me saying so how do i do this then internal facepalm apparently redeeming a roblox code isnt done through the app but through the website browser that took about minutes to figure that out now we just have to login through the web browser to redeem the code ok i look through my phone to see if google has a answer apparently there was another way to navigate though this process upon research you can access the account via time code setup problem time code setup gets sent to the email now the problem is where did it get sent to because there was an parental email setup now she had to call like people on who set this one up turns out they put it on the grandparents email address and you know what happens next i cant login to my email i dont know the password intenal reaction gdi thank gawd her email password reset verification is only though her phone via sms so we reset that password then get the code to access roblox and then we entered the roblox code in the account now funds are there problem this was a short fix converting the currency to robux had to google that one too now onto fortnite same problems different game they dont know the login information and also had to setup a parental account for epic games since the child had restricted access to enter fortnite codes so i had to do a step by step setup for her account so they can redeem fortnite currency fortnite is a little more tame but at this point im so internally frustrated it went as far as reinstalling the entire game because something got messed up from probably what the kid did before coming into the store that was another hours they were in store for about hours and then another hour after the installation thankfully they were patient i helped guests inbetween and answered the usual phone calls as they waited all tasks were done beforehand so its just helping the guests feel bad for the child must of been bored out of his mind trying to get his stuff fixed finally all of that is fixed after forever something time passes theyre good to go both cards are redeemed and the child can do what he wants to buy stuff on there week later grandparent calls complaining they need a verification code because the mother and child was trying to redeem points for an online purchase i told her i dont have access to that thats something thats emailed to you i deleted it i told her she can recover that in the trash folder in the email surprised surprised she didnt know how to find that i even told her that they can hit a button on the same page to resend verification they cant find it told them they can redo the process but concerned that its the same code in the trash and thought the new email will go in the email trash at this point i told her to tell the mother and child to go into their nearby gamestop store and have the rep assist them she tried to tell me that it may be better to have her call me to help them out at a different gamestop when theyre there i just said ill try end of conversation why is the grandparent doing all the work for this child who doesnt know much about technology and the mother is just not helping at all why cant the grandparent communicate with the mother to see if they have all the information needed just incase these things happen write all of this down how do you not know your passwords for all of your accounts make notes somewhere so you dont forget why even bother with all of this if no one is technology literate tldr seriously just tell the child that hes not old enough and let him do something else no point for them to go through all of this just to buy some cosmetics n stuff that will last him like days or just dont buy anything for him on these games if its too hard dont attempt sure technology is hard for people dont pop a vein and sanity for these types of scenarios sorry for the long post just frustrated with customers putting themselves in these situations

69,1695424284.0,prioritizing online orders is a bad move prioritizing ship from store customers is a bad move weve got a foothold in the retail space and are consistently letting down regular customers in favor of our low traffic website gamestops foray into the world of ecommerce should not come at the expense of where most of our money is made ideally these would have had allocations for warehouse shipment with the store inventory reserved solely for store guests or store allocations specifically for sfs orders with separate allocations for customers who didnt preorder forcing sls to fulfill these orders actively screwing over regulars is also idiotic sure they couldve preordered but some people dont its an unfortunate reality and one the company needs to accept the launch should have been instore only so much of our stock was ordered by scalpers on a line that wouldve done huge numbers regardless were letting down walk ins and regulars who may not come back for the next launch there is a demographic that prefers to buy from retail they wont start using our website to order no theyll go to our competitors prioritizing short term gain might increase short term profitability but at the expense of trust and long term retention
67,1692459031.0,so that was a fucking lie i recently stepped down so i missed out on conference this year but the one trend every year is corporate promising changes they walk back almost immediately after conference the type of shit that gets a standing ovation but slowly gets swept under the rug through the holiday the one example i always remember is when they rolled out the pur credit card and explicitly told us they werent gonna track numbers on it and it was simply a tool to help us sell and then low and behold a day into the official roll out were sending roll ups to our dm and rm and getting grilled for not getting apps so im curious what was the dream they sold this year and did they even attempt to address the elephant in the room that is sl
65,1682920345.0,time travel back to with me let me take you back to its a increase in trade day they sent out an email this morning that we are doing a district contest the team that gets the most procards today gets nothing but they do get an email shoutout a family of with horribly behaved kids are running around while you take care of their gigantic blue bin from the s full of nasty treasures from what you can see there are off brand wii remotes with no backs a broken ps with no cords kinects cases with either no game or a scratched asf game that didnt belong in that case ps games worth cents and like ps fifa games from years ago the family expects boku bucks for since its for the new console great they have skylanders too time to get out the cheat sheet ten minutes later jackpot they also have dss sarcasm one is without a serial number and has a partially broken screen with no stylus the parents are mad at you when they find out theyre only getting bucks for the other one that was not stollen at some point oh and they cant remember the password to the child lock they have on it thats nice ill wait for them to call their older child who might know the code you try to sell the procard to them since theyll get more trade credit but they wont because they dont want you to sell their information to rd parties best part the parents are using al this as trade in credit to get a ps and are expecting it for free nope theyre getting like bucks trade in then they and their year old get into an argument in front of the counter because the parents are refusing to front any money towards the system to make up the difference these wise parents are using this situation as a lesson on taking care of your things because apparently if the scratched lastgengames were in good condition theyd have made more bucks meanwhile you are working a saturday morning by yourself you have a line of like one is a regular that always likes to make misogynist jokes and then lingers for an hour after because youre the only female that cant tell him to fuck off at least you can flirt with him to get gpgs he also renews only with you you also have a trade in with a controller that has all the gunk on the sides and worn asf joysticks you pretend you hate it but secretly live for getting the gunk out with the dental tools lastly youve got a ds trade that needs updating and the wifi is slow today the guy has been waiting forever for this thing but he wont take it home since he has no internethow finally the parents give in they do not want insurance on the system tbh i would actually recommend it in this case since we still cover water damage theyre about to leave yay when the kid says they want gta then you have to give the talk about how you can buy a hooker get a lap dance and then sell her to cannibals aka the year old shouldnt be playing it the mom says the kid will play it at the exs house anyway no gpg for you either so you get them the game and they finally hobble off leaving their nasty blue bin behind with some random skylanders you dont take and nasty candy stuck to the bottom finally your backup comes in at pm so you can take a dump because that trenta iced coffee you got at starbucks just so you could get through the morning gave you diarrhea

67,1707752031.0,my strangest complaint made about me when i was working at gamestop my boss and i who for importance to the story are white always shared a laugh about this we were in a mall store no bell sound was made when someone walked in there were no doors it was just an open area i have always been on top of it when greeting people when they came in asking how their day was if they need help anything we had a bunch of distro and it was almost time for my manager to go on break so we wanted to finish a hell box of games before he left i had my back turned to the counter and my long hair was blocking my vision of the door learned after this to move it behind my ear if possible to put a stack of games in the drawer when i did so this woman who was africanamerican for context had walked in and neither me or my manager saw her walk in i turned around to get another stack of games and put them away when i see another woman who i thought was the only woman in the store and was white which is important to the story walk in i greet her and carry on then the first woman walks up to the counter and starts berating me for not greeting her and how dare i not greet her because she is black and i am white and thats racist meanwhile i am trying to explain to her that i did not see her and i apologize she still complaining to me and asks to see my manager so i call him over and he also explains that we are sorry and it is abnormal for me not to greet customers and that when she walked in we mustve had our backs to the door and did not see her and both of us apologized again that wasnt good enough for her so after getting fed up with her complaining and yelling at us for minutes at this point and the other customer was visibly uncomfortable and left i ask her if how she would like us to correct it she states we need to greet her when shes first here im a smart ass and say well welcome to gamestop and if you have any questions please let us know with the most people pleasing grin she then stated she was going to call corporate and complain about us my boss died laughing as soon as she left and i got a free lunch that day think it was my first year being there been a guest for almost a year now and i miss these stupid instances

64,1700604686.0,i dislike dealing with people who come in for cash trades trades are my least favorite thing to deal with especially since gamestop made cash trades a thing making all sorts of unsavory individuals come in and try to pawn off random junk half of which is usually stolen had several people with clearly stolen switches tried and convince me that it was the whole thing when they didnt have the dock grip straps hdmi or power cable they probably just stole it off some kids at the bus stop one guy who didnt have the components told me there might be a game still inside i asked him point blank what the name of the game was and the dude started visibly sweeting before saying he changed his mind and running out out aide obvious thieves it gets even more annoying when they complain about the trade credit difference when you tell them it is what it is and dont control that they try and pull your arm giving all sorts of sob stories as if that makes a damn bit of difference i allways tell them that if you dont like the youre getting you could allways put it towards credit and get more for the next time you come in yo shop with us but of course they immediately go oh i dont play games which makes the game or system they are selling me suspect the weird ones who think i decide the prices are the worse especially when they go do you know another gamestop i can try honey youre going to get the same amount there as you would here

66,1685862401.0,this is how we are appreciated just received an email about how gamestops tenure recognition program is about to be shut down and i need to spend my points before it does so after years with the company ive earned points first off the website does t really have a lot for a selection unless youre looking for gift cards oddly enough if you want a gamestop gift card you can only get and but every other gift card has all sorts of denominations but if i purchase something and i dont have enough points i can just pay for it out of pocket so just goofing around i look through the electronics page and see an lg class series tv it needs an insane amount of points but i use my measly k and just want to see what i would pay out of pocket for this tv i would have to pay so for years of my life and k i can get a brand new tv or i can just go to best buy and buy the exact same tv for such a slap in the face why is this company so afraid to show appreciation for its employees i refuse to believe there is that much of a disconnect between corporate and store level why is this company so afraid to show any sort of compassion or appreciation to the people who have helped keep this company alive for the past years especially the last years and no sending me a tshirt with a rocket ship on it is not appreciation its bandwagon bs you force new managers to run multiple locations while severely understaffed cut our hours down to bare minimum cut our ability for overtime deny raises for sls going on years now but we got stock options though we get taxed twice on those stocks they have already lost of value and we dont have full access to the for years how are we suppose to feel appreciated here i have been here for as long as i have because i love what i do i love my stores my teams my peers and my guests i credit this place for making me a better leadermentor i would not be who i am without these last years here but gamestop doesnt care about me gamestop does not care about sls sls asls sgas and gas no one from corporate dls rls no one cares they just dont i have no faith that anyone knows what they are doing there is no real direction and just seems like they are running this company by rolling some dice at least with some companies i would at least be a number im not a number here im just another drone pushing whatever agenda they are focusing on each week gamestop you really need to reevaluate your priorities your business runs because of your stores start taking care of your stores start taking care of your associates tldr years of my life and i can get a new tv

53,1706124624.0,idiot employee in the can update shes officially been fired so theres this employee an sga whos a bit of an idiot she had poor training with our previous wreck of an asl so she had a small excuse when it came to certain things this employee lost three systems because she went to the back and brought them out this was in december the customers kept asking them to go grab more systems and she did needless to say three systems got snatched flash forward to monday she texts our groupchat no youre not supposed to message the groupchat about work related things saying that she cant close down the computers or count the safe due to circumstances out of her control everyone else is beyond confused its past the end of her shift my sl and i get in today and immediately check the cameras to figure out what happened here she had boxes everywhere distro rsbs all over the place over hours she didnt fully complete a single box and just kept opening more she also did not lock a single drawer she handed a preordered item over without a transaction luckily the item was fully paid off but that customer was actually owed a refund because of pro and then she starts a transaction for a system grabs the binder scans from it goes to the back grabs the system and scans the system again she didnt cross out the system she sold and the book was right theres just no excuse anyways im pulling my hair out over this one its just ridiculous at this point she didnt call another store when she had issues with the computer or our dm or it but claimed she did everything in her power to figure it out she called myself and my sl six times each respectively needless to say she will probably be fired here soon note i know this is not due to a lack of corrective training on our end because another employee who received the same training under the poor excuse of an asl has been wonderful this was an interesting way to end my last week i get promoted to customer saturday its been a good run boys good luck to those surviving
