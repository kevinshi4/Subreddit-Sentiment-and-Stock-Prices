benchmark tbd rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer program with free sdks stateoftheart deep learning courses certification and access to

problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer program with free sdks stateoftheart deep learning courses certification and access to expert help sound interesting learn more here,0.9286502326722256,0.0,-0.4092361629009247,0.9906

rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer program with free sdks stateoftheart deep learning courses certification and access to expert help sound

long time reader long time nvidia owner slight game dev hobbyist i lurk around a bunch in various subreddits and youtube comments for various tech youtubers just to keep in tune with the market and what people are feeling and ive found that theres a lot of misleading kinds of comments that get pushed around a lot so much so that it drowns out the legitimately interesting or exciting things happening in the market so i thought id just spit out my opinions on all these talking points and see if people respond or have interesting counterpoints i dont intend for people to immediately change their mind about things just after reading me i hope you read a lot of peoples opinions and come to your own conclusions gpu prices are insane i agree with this statement although theres a bit more to it traditionally maybe years ago and older graphics cards would be succeeded by newer cards that come in at lower prices those newer cards would seem like such great deals and the older cards would naturally drop in price in the market to adjust for this lost demand nowadays depending on where youre from at least what ive noticed in australia various gpus come down in price very gradually over the course of their generation cards that would launch for usd end up around usd or so by the time the next graphics cards come out this means a couple of things msrp really only indicates the launching price of the products when considering a new card you should consider the current prices at a certain point in time and that means everyones opinions are temporal and may change very quickly if cards keep bouncing around in prices for example the amd rx regularly hits around aud down here but the rtx has been consistently aud if we compared msrp the should be a lot cheaper but it isnt so my opinion would be the opposite of what it currently is but your countrys market may differ to so its good to just check around and see what prices are the newer graphics cards seem to keep coming in at roughly the same price to performance ratio as what older cards are at the same time the rtx is an insane aud msrp but for its price to performance its remarkably close to being quite linear compared to the existing rtx cards here as well this ties into the price fluctuating midgeneration it does make newer releases a lot less exciting but in general theyre not bad value just no better value again please decide for yourself based on your own market prices your desire for more graphics may actually be artificially pressured this is a bit accusatory of me but theres a lot of people all over the internet including here who definitely push that you need an rtx ti or a for k gaming and will cite various games that do indeed require those cards to achieve framerates above fps when running with all the settings cranked out if i worked at nvidia i would love nothing more than to tell people they need s but that also assumes that people only play the newest games play these games in their generally more unoptimised states dont turn down some needless settings like antialiasing it irks me how many benchmark youtube channels will crank up msaa in their k tests if you generally play some older titles and i mean like years ago or older which isnt that old or you can toy around with settings a bit a lot of these games will still run at very good levels of detail and framerate on older cards eg the can still run better looking games fine if youre tweaking in the right places i do wish cheaper cards were back on the market again theres too many price gaps in the market the cheapest nvidia card you can buy here is aud and theres no amd cards between aud and aud the problem isnt that the is aud its that by the time the rest of the rtx s come out there wont be a new gpu for under aud until the prices gradually drop again and thats a market that i feel is just underused gb of vram is not enough this ties into the previous point a little but give me a moment to explain the scenario the vast majority of users as per the steam hardware surveys run cards with less than gb of vram youd also be surprised that the only gpus that have more than gb of vram right now are the gtx ti rtx ti gb ti ti ti and the last titan cards which stops at pascal for every other manufacturer this only allows the intel a special edition every amd rdna gpu from the rx and up and the amd radeon vii besides the radeon vii no consumer amd gpu released before november years ago has more than gb of vram now weve had a lot of generations of cards with exactly gb of vram but i occasionally see some comments say that if gb isnt enough now then gb may not be enough in years time i dont think this is as pressuring a concern for a few reasons the handful of newer games that are pushing this amount of vram are just that a handful they also fall into one of two camps some games like the last of us are abysmally unoptimised as seen by the horrendous graphics when you turn all the settings down but you still require to some amount of graphics power to push meanwhile some other games like the resident evil remake actually run very smoothly at p on a super even with the settings on the modest balanced preset which still looks very good ill let you be the judge on graphics fidelity but i do wish more people saw how good some of these newer games still look on older hardware even with some settings turned down if a game looks worse with the same gpu load thats an unoptimised game if the game looks fine or better thats just a game with a larger window of graphics options if you want to play a newer game just double check other review sites or youtube videos to confirm whether that game runs and looks fine with your graphics card and youll be surprised how many cases you dont actually need a better graphics card to play these games crysis should be your basis of what ultra graphics means crysis came out at the end of and if you try running the game at p and crank every setting up to its maximum the game will try to allocate about gb of vram gb sounds fairly tame these days but youd be surprised to hear that the highest amount of vram on an nvidia card at the time was gb on the brand newly released gt it wouldnt be until when the gtx was released with gb of memory and even then the settings would be crushing on graphics cards until personally the kepler based gtx cards of course we have the memes today of can it run crysis but thats because the highest settings were very forward looking and were never expected to run on the hardware at the time as long as the game could run on current hardware and still look good with some configuration of the graphics settings thats the victory they were seeking ultra settings do make the game appear better historically though as people nowadays can play crysis with the settings turned up making the game seem much more visually impressive than it possibly was back then i suspect newer games and especially some features like cyberpunks path tracing mode are pushing the same graphical showcase but realistically they expect most people to tone down settings ultra is almost always indiscernible at p for high i dont believe ultra is a realistic or practical setting in a lot of cases for new games and especially now that were pushing higher quality textures and models in games again as storage is a lot faster and larger now at some point you realistically wont see any of this detail at p i urge you if you have a newer graphics card and a newer game at p turn the settings down a little bit and try and spot any graphical faults that are not present in the ultra preset whether it be blurry textures or obvious polygons allocation of vram is not utilisation unused memory is wasted memory so if a game is able to leverage more memory allocation it probably will one example i bring up is doom eternal which has a setting that purely determines how much memory is allocated for the texture cache it doesnt actually affect the quality of the textures but increasing the cache can reduce disk load unfortunately back in some people i remember a hardware unboxed video touted that this setting meant that gb of vram wasnt enough for games anymore but with an understanding of what the setting does it doesnt actually mean the game ever needed that much video memory to make prettier images its purely just permitting the game to allocate that much memory newer games have this same issue the new star wars game would just allocate basically as much memory as available if your gpu had gb of vram youd probably want to be able to utilise it to its fullest you may be surprised to hear that your vram allocation actually will change depending on your graphics card like how google chrome can work on computers with gb of ram but will consume gb if you had gb of total memory some games are also very greedy just to reduce calls to the os to allocate memory and will just take as much as they potentially want especially because most people arent running much gpu intensive work while playing games there are still cases of unoptimised memory usage out there see the last of us so keep an eye out mentioning again this only really matters if you play games brand new im going to be critical here but a lot of commenters on this site werent alive when skyrim came out and havent played it i encourage you even games that are years old theres a lot of great experiences that arent the newest games so dont let people convince you you need to get a brand new rtx card if theres a good deal on an older rtx card if youre not going to be playing a lot of brand new games like that to be critical of nvidia i do believe theyre pulling some market segmentation to separate their higher clocking geforce cards from the higher memory workstation cards for ai this has meant that vram is kept rather lean and i do agree were getting to a weird point where some games would run fine if they had a bit more vram and i especially agree its not good to be paying that much for a gpu over a competitor only to have a clearly faltering use case but id still say in general theyre still workable i anticipate we wont have a lot of these scenarios soon as newer games may try and push more graphics work most likely more raytracing passes newer rt games do so much more work than battlefield vshadow of the tomb raider and will run a bit more aggressively at ultra on even the cards with more vram that being said i do believe with the rise of ai wed find more value in cards that naturally are able to perform both graphics rendering and ai trainingexecution with high amounts of vram and i do desire more vram in future cards without trading off the rest of the performance we do run into a catch though where the cards are going to become more expensive because of this though so all i can desire is that we have plenty of options of cards for different use cases and enough competition from amd and intel to drive these prices down xx class card this sort of ties in with the price but this is a particular comment i see copy pasted so much around the name of the card means very little especially to us were in tune were aware of how well these cards perform and ultimately what you should be comparing is cards at a certain price vs their performance we dont complain that in the past intel is had half the core count of intel is and now they have a sixth so therefore theyre celeron class cpus and thats because we see how much relevant performance you get for the price a current intel i can definitely get more than half the framerate of an equal machine with an intel i and thats why we still consider an intel i somewhat valuable although its fair to say a little bit more money gets you a meaningful performance boost too similarly for gpus i saw that the ti which performs in games about as well as a while using a bit less power when it had dipped to aud here seemed like a solid good card yes it is under half the cuda cores of a but its also well under half the price at the end of the day what matters is what you can do with the card and whether its worth that price the last xx card before the was the gtx which also was an absurdly expensive card this was back in the dual card days where it was effectively two gtx s in sli but to abstract away from that we wouldnt complain that a gtx was only half of the flagships core count because in the end it was also half the price the was really bad value when it came out so even though we may say that the wasnt as stripped down to the as the is to the the was also purely a chart topper product and wasnt really worth it especially if you played only games this has adjusted a fair bit before the stock for these cards started to diminish the titan cards effectively were what the xx cards are now and i dont recall a lot of places considering those cards the same as cards like the ti and the ti because they had that unique name to them just like the they were also very poor value if you considered just games the ti and ti were anomalously good value and as much as id love for cards like that to keep appearing i think someone at nvidia saw that they can get more profit out of charging more for cards of that calibre nvidia is a publicly traded business and their one goal is to make as much profit as possible i dont want to apologise for nvidia and we as consumers should do our best to only buy things that are good deals but i think we should recognise that the ti was too good a deal in our favour and well only ever get a scenario like that again if theres some proper competition happening in the gpu space again upgrading from a rtx card dont a lot of people here think they need the latest and greatest every generation but in reality you dont this ties in with the artificial desire for better graphics too youre not missing out on much by not being a first adopter of dlss fg technology just like youre still not missing out even if you dont have an rtx card yet upgrade when you personally want to run something and youre unhappy with the performance usually that happens if youve upgraded your monitor to a higher resolution or refresh rate and you want to provide as many frames as you can to that monitor but very rarely will a new game come out that just runs and looks worse than previous games and as mentioned above this is quite often due to just poor optimisation in the launch youtube channels being treated as gospel i watch a few different youtube channels that talk about tech leveltechs gamers nexus derbauer and the best thing all these channels provide is different areas of investigation allowing the viewer to come to their own opinion about certain hardware its impossible for one outlet to actually cover all the nuance of a gpu in one video even if they try and throw a lot of gaming and productivity benchmarks and comparing various graphics cards for example one thing i really enjoyed about derbauer in the recent cpu releases is that he tested the various processors at different power levels and showed how efficient every new cpu could be when you drop the power levels obviously some were more efficient than others but it was a clear counter point to other reviewers that would put pictures of fires in their thumbnails and call the cpu a furnace i do get frustrated a lot when a reviewer comes to the wrong conclusion after lots of valid data but i do think as long as people talk very openly about their experiences and these reviews people can figure out whats correct and whats not unfortunately theres a lot of comments that go along the lines of x reviewer said this and ill copy paste it here and i get it that k subscriber youtube channels seem more trustworthy than random comments on reddit but i think its very easy for single opinions to fall into the trap of believing something just because one person said it and as a general reddit and internet pitfall we also cant blindly agree with single comments lots of paid advertising and bots on the internet so i think the best thing is to read multiple sources trust but verify as they say i hope you enjoyed reading my long soliloquy there i just wanted to jot everything ive felt in the past few months about the market discussions and the games themselves let me know if im really wrong on anything because i want to understand what everyones thinking a bit more tldr dont get upsold on hardware you dont actually

virtual shadow maps high framerates and low latency optimization guide in chapter fortnite recieved a massive visual overhaul with the addition of unreal engine s core features such as nanite virtualized geometry lumen software ray tracing and virtual shadow maps epics new temporal super resolution offers upscaling improvements for all systems these new graphical features take the visual fidelity of fortnite to a whole new level but come with a large performance hit in this guide ive tested each individual setting and have created optimized settings that offer incredible graphics high frame rates and low latency disclaimer dx rendering mode will have stutters hitches and lag for the first games every time you change graphics settings after playing a few games the lag and stutters will go away frame rates will stabilize and smoothness will improve it is important to know that its very likely your stutters are not due to high graphics settings but due to the nature of fortnite on dx and it will improve and smooth out after games or so this will improve the more you play its important to optimize your graphics to achieve your desired framerate and quality and stick with it to let dx optimize and smooth out before making any rash decisions graphics settings their associated performance hit testing was done at p with nanite on as nanite is required for lumen and virtual shadows each run was done on low settings with each individual setting turned up to epic to see what that individual setting costs in performance graphics settings are in order of their performance hit largest to smallest benchmark runaverage fpsperformance cost baseline dx low nanite on virtual shadows epicfps global illumination lumen epicfps effects epicfps view distance epicfps post processing epicfps reflections lumen epicfps textures epicfps optimizing the most graphically intensive settings as we can see virtual shadows and lumen global illumination come with the largest performance hit on the other hand textures reflectionseven lumen post processing do not have quite a large performance hit considering lumen gi and shadows come at a huge cost these are the two settings we are most concerned about optimizing switching virtual shadows to high comes in at a performance hit whereas epic costs you virtual shadows on high still look very good you can further turn down the shadows to medium however the draw distance and quality of the shadows will be reduced significantly vs high it can be difficult to tell the difference between high and epic shadows but high does cost much less than epic as for global illumination lumen high costs you a performance hit vs lumen epics performance hit you can make a judgement call here but for me lumen high looks stellar so ill take the peformance improvement by using high instead of epic effects come in at an performance hit after all this is a competitive game effects can be very distracting especially the bloom from firing weapons can make it very difficult to see id highly recommend running effects on low its hard to tell the difference between low medium and high and running on low will save you approximately in performance as for view distance this has been changed and now also affects the foliage on the ground in the past post processing on low would remove individual flowers and grass strands making the ground look similar to performance rendering mode this is no longer the case and the rendering of grass strands and flowers are controlled by view distance since the star wars update setting the view distance to high or epic has distinct advantages like being able to see items and weapons at a much further distance high only saves compared to epic optimized settings for highend systems rtx above

battle royal after all youre going to want to use upscaling to reduce visual noise recover framerate reduce latency recommended upscaling modes based on your resolution xdlss quality xdlss balanced xdlss performance using epic textures hardly cost any performance but will visually improve the results of upscaling quite significantly upscaling modes tested at p vs baseline fps avg native on optimized settings dlss quality fps dlss balanced fps dlss performance fps it is recommended you stay with the upscaling mode designed for your render resolution for instance at p using the balanced setting if you are looking for some more performance you can use a more intensive upscaling mode like performance at p but this will result in some visual softness compared to the ideal setting id recommend further reducing post processing textures and then shadows to medium if you can not achieve a playable framerate while using the recommended upscaling mode reducing latency for nvidia users nvidia reflex is integrated directly into fortnite scroll to the bottom of the graphics settings and enable nvidia reflex on boost cleaning up screen tearing do not use in game vsync in game vsync comes at a severe latency penalty i am aware and educated on the proper way to use gsync which is vsync on in the nvidia control panel off in game settings with gsync on and a framerate limiter in place i would notrecommend using gsync like this in fortnite ive played on controller and mouse keyboard and i feel as if vsync even enabled as stated by the trust worthy guys at blurbusters makes aiming and movement in this game feel odd i would not use vsync in any form in fortnite instead nvidia reflex onboost gsync on cap fps below monitors refresh rate fps for hz monitor and so on this is essentially fastsync and wont completely eliminate screen tearing but in my experience it will significantly reduce tearing while not adding any latency penalty for those seeking the lowest possible latency on these settings id recommend running uncapped with your monitor in fixed refresh mode with nvidia reflex onboost and just dealing with the frame tearing complete optimized settings in game

need to play around games for dx to optimize and for the stutters to disappear testing and benchmarking was done with an rtx ti and ryzen xd at p your milage may vary but using this guide im playing at fps while using ue s latest tech i feel no latency penalty using these settings vs performance mode with a fps cap i hope it can do the same for you ideally i think an rx xt or rtx and above is the minimum youd want to have to use all of the latest tech in ue while retaining a respectable frame rate and relatively low latency if you find lumen too dark in some indoor settings try adjusting the black level on your monitor my lg has a black stabilizer setting and setting that from to makes the game look perfect i hope this guide helped you achieve fps while using unreal engine s amazing

random flicker on certain displays when gsync is enabled after updating to driver click here to download the geforce hotfix display driver for windows x windows x a geforce driver is an incredibly complex piece of software we have an army of software engineers constantly adding features and fixing bugs these changes are checked into the main driver branches which are eventually run through a massive qa process and released since we have so many changes being checked in we usually try to align driver releases with significant game or product releases this process has served us pretty well over the years but it has one significant weakness sometimes a change that is important to many users might end up sitting and waiting until we are able to release the driver the geforce hotfix driver is our way to trying to get some of these fixes out to you more quickly these drivers are basically the same as the previous released version with a small number of additional targeted fixes the fixes that make it in are based in part on your feedback in the driver feedback threads and partly on how realistic it is for us to quickly address them these fixes and many more will be incorporated into the next official driver release at which time the hotfix driver will be taken down to be sure these hotfix drivers are beta optional and provided asis they are run through a much abbreviated qa process the sole reason they exist is to get fixes out to you more quickly the safest option is to wait for the next whql certified driver but we know that many of you are willing to try these out as a result we only provide nvidia hotfix drivers through our nvidia customer care support site these hotfix drivers represent a lot of additional work by our engineering teams we hope they provide value

issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know

driver benchmark tbd rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer program with free sdks stateoftheart deep learning courses certification and access to

feedback link here submit driver feedback directly to nvidia link here rodrogs driver benchmark tbd rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer program with free sdks

having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know

driver forum for feedback tbd submit driver feedback directly to nvidia link here rodrogs driver benchmark tbd rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer

forum for feedback link here submit driver feedback directly to nvidia link here rodrogs driver benchmark tbd rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer

released article here game ready driver download link link here studio driver download link link here new feature and fixes in driver game ready this new game ready driver provides the best gaming experience for the latest new games supporting dlss technology and dlss ray reconstruction including cyberpunk phantom liberty further support for new titles leveraging nvidia dlss technology includes the launch of warhaven and witchfire which support dlss as well as the arrival of party animals which supports dlss super resolution and nvidia reflex technology applications the september nvidia studio driver provides optimal support for the latest new creative applications and updates this includes davinci resolve version which features nvidia tensorrt acceleration as well as the latest chaos vantage update which introduces support for dlss ray reconstruction fixed gaming bugs na fixed general bugs octane render intersection shaders cause slowdown in performance octane render inconsistent behavior and broken motion keys using tlas with numkeys open issues halo infinite significant performance drop is observed on maxwellbased gpus davinci resolve this driver implements a fix for creative application stability issues seen during heavy memory usage weve observed some situations where this fix has resulted in performance degradation when running davinci resolve this will be addressed in an upcoming driver release additional open issues from geforce forums notes this is not new manuel from nvidia has been tracking any additional driver issues in their forum post separate from release notes last post was the first time i am including them here and will do so moving forward small checkerboard like pattern may randomly appear in chromium based applications some

driver benchmark tbd rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer program with free sdks stateoftheart deep learning courses certification and access to

to make this writeup to hopefully provide insight into the absolute mess that is nvidias compatibility with display steam compression dsc and discuss the problems i had in setting up a k high refresh rate display on my windows pc with an rtx my full specs list is here the rtx is an excellent card for k gaming at the moment especially when paired with dlss and dlfg i recently upgraded from a lg gp to a lg gpr as i decided it was time for the resolution upgrade previously i had used a samsung sag with my rtx for a time but in both cases my experience was the same so i can say this is true for both lg and samsung firmware and almost certainly others and series and series gpus thus its easy to conclude that this is a driver problem there is a great reddit post here that details the issues of bandwidth relating to blackscreens when alt tabbing this forum post here also gives somewhat relevant numbers on bandwidth used when calculating refresh rate and resolution here are my findings nvidia drivers when using dsc do not work properly with vulkan or opengl games in these cases there will be an approx s blackscreen when alt tabbing regardless of fullscreen or borderless window mode this is not the case for dx dx games my monitor supports disabling dsc via the osd in doing so you are locked at hz but also you cannot select rgb color profile and are locked at which does not look good i do not recommend this in theory you could also manually setup a custom resolution but i could not get this to work when setting a custom hz resolution dsc is still used for some reason i suppose there is overhead yet it was still the case going down to hz i did not test lower reducing bandwidth in other ways such as changing the color space or just lowering refresh further will eventually solve the problem as you wont use dsc but again this doesnt really help as you are losing too much nvidia supports gsync compatibility via hdmi this means that given my monitor supports gbps hdmi i can play at high refresh rate hz max as the hz oc requires dp and have no issues alt tabbing in any games as it will not use dsc the bug noted in the current open issues some monitors may display random black screen flicker when in display stream compression mode when using r drivers is not related to the main issue in this post whilst this problem did occur for me occasionally literally as described with random black screens it is not the same as the alt tab blackscreen issue i am describing this open issue is claimed to be fixed in the r release branch really my conclusion here is that the setup for k high refresh rate on windows is overly complicated and buggy simply due to the issues surrounding dsc interaction with nvidia drivers from what i can find online this is not a problem with amd radeon or intel arc given gpus are powerful enough to push these framerates now and gamers generally prefer dp over hdmi its embarrassing that such problems are still prevalent and someone less technical or less patient would be put off on this tech the hdmi solution is also not catch all as it prevents monitor osd overclocks may not always play nicely with gsync and not all hdmi monitors support the full gbps bandwidth that would be required to drive k high refresh rate without dsc hopefully this post is useful just to shine some light on this issue and to create some discussion around it as a reference point for nvidia or microsoft to hopefully resolve these issues is this a complete deal breaker no is it very annoying and will it become more prevalent as people upgrade their gpus and monitors yes edit i wanted to make a quick summary based on the discussion in this thread firstly please do read this post as it provides excellent numerical context on what i am discussing if you are a tv owner many lg c people here then you are not affected by this problem as the gbps hdmi ports on that display allow you to reach these resolutions and refresh rates without dsc this post is specifically about displayport on monitors or monitors without a full hdmi gbps port similarly as noted using hdmi does technically resolve this issue though even then you cannot seamlessly alt tab in nondirectx titles without a blackscreen display redraw but it means you lose out on proper gsync support and monitor onscreen display overclocks i want to reiterate that i am not referring to the random blackscreens noted in the driver open issues this is specifically about alt tabbing in vulkan opengl games in my own testing i could not find any directx game that exhibited this problem but all nondirectx games i tested did some examples include minecraft java opengl rainbow six siege vulkan only red dead redemption vulkan only no mans sky vulkan the behaviour is the same in borderless and fullscreen though nowadays you should be using a fullscreen optimised dxgi flip model so testing for fullscreen exclusive is irrelevant here is a video example this does not just affect highrefresh rate k but will also affect extreme highrefresh rate p and also higher color depths combined with high refresh rates resolutions essentially if you exceed dp bandwidth you will be using dsc,0.9962392379529774,0.0,-0.4152832478284836,0.7733

issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know

feedback link here submit driver feedback directly to nvidia link here rodrogs driver benchmark tbd rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer program with free sdks

with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer program with free sdks stateoftheart deep learning courses certification and access to expert help sound interesting learn more here,0.958512577228248,0.0,-0.4120239540934562,0.9935

not to have to come here to complain but given what you can read in the title i feel like i have no choice now timeline below wednesday october found out the vhpwr connector had melted a bit on my card after unplugging it while doing some routine cleaning of my case not a super bad melt but a melt nonetheless got in touch with nvidia customer support who was still pretty responsive and quick at this point and got me an rma label by friday night which i then used to have everything shipped out by sunday thursday october gpu is delivered to nvidia and in the evening of the following monday october i get a shipment notification for a replacement unit so far so good i think to myself in terms of timing even if the nightmare has really yet to begin that shipment notification indicates the units part number ends with rf instead of which indicates this is a refurbished unit wednesday november the refurbished replacement unit arrives despite being skeptical of receiving a refurbished unit obviously i have to give it a chance but for my own protection i make a video recording of me unboxing it and lo and behold this thing is in sht condition for reference the following damages were present io plate is bentwarped in multiple directions and as my case is already a tight fit im confident this wouldnt even have fit sure you could argue that i couldve taken some pliers and straightened it out but forgive me if im wrong but i spent over k cad on this card call me a princess or diva or whatever you want but i paid too damn much for this to jankily be modifying it just to be able to fit in my case and risking further damage sense pins in vhpwr connector were also bentmisaligned this issue may have even been more serious as it was contact issues in the vhpwr connector that were believed to have caused the melting issues in the first place this issue alone was enough for me not to feel comfortable plugging this into a power source whatsoever even if it did fit notwithstanding the bent io plate as mentioned above seriously wobblymisaligned exhaust fan while i understand this doesnt necessarily imply a brokennonfunctioning fan per se my experience with wobbly fans is they usually tend to become audibly rumbly or even entirely dislodged over time usually the span of a few years and im not about to take a chance on this becoming a reality after my warranty is up years down the line general cosmetic neglect and filth as observed through scratchesscuffs all around the unit obviously this is much more noticeable with matte black surfaces like those on the backplates of the fe cards but still bent radiator fins and flakes of human skin and hair lodged in the various crevices throughout ugh i get that cosmetic imperfections are somewhat to be expected with refurbished aka used units but when i pay k for something i feel like i cant be alone in saying i take impeccable care of it and expect anyone else handling it on my behalf to do the same in any case if the unit i sent in is in such a condition i expect to receive back something in as good of a condition especially when ive only had the gpu since february in any case i reopened another rma request with reasoning and pictures to the effects described above saturday november my request for a second rma is approved and i ship it out that weekend thursday november the refurbished unit arrives back at nvidia for reference all shipping was done with the prepaid fedex labels provided by nvidia and the waiting game begins monday november after calling several times just to hear the same bs answer of keep waiting over and over again a level support member by the name of jason is assigned to the case and informs via email me that a technical issue prevented my rma from being processed up until the week prior but that it had now been resolved and that a replacement unit has been requested from the warehouse okay only a matter of days now i think to myself but given that i am here posting on this subreddit today its obvious that i was sorely mistaken monday november i follow up by email to jason again the prior night asking for an update given im at the point where i havent had a discrete gpu in my pc since midoctober i sht you not his verbatim response was your query was raised with the warehouse last week and again today i have not heard back yet but will update when i have news to share guys im at my limit here while i can appreciate that the normally within business days upon receiving your return timeline for sending back a replacement may not always be possible to make good on lmfao clearly seeing as we are on business day since november now it is this lack of transparency and expectation of me to keep waiting indefinitely without any sort of clarity on a timeline around when i can get a real fking answer from nvidia as to when i can roughly expect to get back one of the single most expensive things i have ever bought that is absolutely not cool i have also told them that even if the answer they have for me is not the answer i want to hear such as they have no inventory of s to send i would rather know of this rather than keep being kept in the dark with nothing more than a weekly keep waiting update for all eternity its clear that nvidias consumer products division is very siloed given all the departments of level support level support and the rma team warehouse seem to be connected by nothing more than the occasional email between one another and while im not one to pretend i know of a better way to run a nowtrillion dollar market cap company i am going to say that this is making for a reprehensible customer experience im at the point where im probably on a first name basis with all the level supports that answer customer phone calls and its not fair to them to constantly have to deal with me when they really cant do anything but tell me reply to the email chain with the assigned level support member on it jason who henceforth doesnt seem to be able to do anything but ping the warehouse occasionally for an update though him maybe trying to get more directly in touch with the warehouse such as over the phone would honestly be appreciated if he has that ability that is and also just tell me to keep waiting thus im hoping that one of the nvidia subreddit mods can read this to please provide me some clarity on why the holdup and if there really is an issue of inventory shortage for example to find a way to work with me such as a refund or a definitive date of the next restocked batch coming in from which i can get a unit for reference my incident number with customer support is while my case number and rma number as they relate to rma case itself are and respectively xb update wednesday

geforce hotfix display driver version is based on our latest game ready driver this hotfix addresses the following issues discord when streaming gameplay colors may appear muted intermittent stutter may be observed when vsync is enabled a geforce driver is an incredibly complex piece of software we have an army of software engineers constantly adding features and fixing bugs these changes are checked into the main driver branches which are eventually run through a massive qa process and released since we have so many changes being checked in we usually try to align driver releases with significant game or product releases this process has served us pretty well over the years but it has one significant weakness sometimes a change that is important to many users might end up sitting and waiting until we are able to release the driver the geforce hotfix driver is our way to trying to get some of these fixes out to you more quickly these drivers are basically the same as the previous released version with a small number of additional targeted fixes the fixes that make it in are based in part on your feedback in the driver feedback threads and partly on how realistic it is for us to quickly address them these fixes and many more will be incorporated into the next official driver release at which time the hotfix driver will be taken down to be sure these hotfix drivers are beta optional and provided asis they are run through a much abbreviated qa process the sole reason they exist is to get fixes out to you more quickly the safest option is to wait for the next whql certified driver but we know that many of you are willing to try these out as a result we only provide nvidia hotfix drivers through our nvidia customer care support site click here to download the geforce hotfix display driver version for windows x windows x these hotfix drivers represent a lot of additional work by our engineering teams we hope they provide value for you game ready driver has

would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many

to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are

avoid rmaing my fe gb for as long as i could due to all the horror stories i have read but unfortunately ive held off long enough at this point as the artificing issue i had was only getting worse i had to do it so heres the timeline on how that went xb nov contacted nvidia via chat i explained all the troubleshoot step ive taken to resolve the issue but had no luck rep decides an rma is best i sent it over via fedex drop off as soon as the qr code label was sent now mind you this is the day before thanksgiving so i knew this would take a bit to reach them nov after becoming anxious for a couple days i finally receive a notice from fedex that theres movement for my package and a date for delivery was set dec nvidia finally receives my package after days waiting for update dec received a notification via fedex that a package was on its way to me from nvidia received no contact from nvidia or omni their distributor matter of fact if it wasnt for me having the fedex app on my phone i use it to keep track on whats coming to my address i wouldve never known something was coming to me at all already getting irritated with the lack of communication on nvidias end dec after getting a notification of delivery and finding out the package was dropped off at a neighbors door ugh i finally have the package in my hand its a refurbished replacement unit i should be done right so i start gaming everything was fine after a fresh driver uninstall via ddu and a fresh install of the gpu driver for about an hour til driver errors started popping up and crashing games im noticing via hwmonitor that the vram was much hotter than my original unit i installed a fresh new copy of windows and the gpu driver and even gave it days but unfortunately the problem persists dec contacted nvidia again and explained the situation with the replacement unit they decide to rma again great not really sent it as soon as the qr code came in dec nvidia received the package more waiting game dec notification from fedex that nvidia sent something same deal no contact from nvidia or omni woohoo im sure thisll be delayed again due to christmas tracking says itll get there days later yeah right dec received package another refurbished unit aaaaand the io bracket is bent great just great but hey at least it works and theres no issue should i even bother with another rma for the io bracket damage or just bend it back myself at this point xb honestly i think the length of wait for this rma is unacceptable i think sending me a defective refurb unit do they not test their refurbs before shipping it across the literal other side of the country like come on then a damaged refurb unit is unacceptable i think the lack of communication is unacceptable i think everything ive gone through in general is unacceptable again i cant act dumb ive seen all the rma horror stories before and thats why ive held off from rmaing for so long ive never been an entitled person but if a customer is willing to drop a good amount of money for an expensive product theyre paying for top tier service for a top tier product are they not even shipping this thing across the country was a risk as ive seen stories about lost rma packages and nvidia not taking responsibility and even calling you a liar at times nvidia has to do better man that goes for their entire process this is beyond unacceptable for such a large corporation on the flipside i always hear nothing but positive rma experiences from msi asus evga rip etc from express replacements part replacements even free upgrades third party companies being better than the actual company that creates this thing unbelievable tldr after a garbage rma experience i think im staying away from fe models i think sticking with other manufacturers are the way to go moving forward nvidia do better edit some of you are saying that the st rma sounds like it was fine it was not tried it on different rigs that being my wifes my brothers and my own and for those that are saying the nd rmas io bracket being bent is not a big deal just bend it back thats literally not the point i sent them an undamaged great condition unit and i expected the same thing back i was not expecting a brand new unit either as that would be dumb to think so im not sure why some of yall are trying to imply that clearly the gb model has not been sold brand new for a while im totally okay with a refurb as long as its the same condition as the unit i gave them do you know the definition of refurbished would you accept anything less finally i also did not imply that other manufacturers are without flaws either but the amount of positive rma stories that ive heard from them outweigh the plethora of nvidia horror stories obviously theres still gonna be some horror stories here and there no matter the manufacturer edit ended up buying a msi and gifting my to my wife shes happy so i cant complain also i cannot believe the amount of responses im getting telling me to just fix the issue myself by checking the thermal pads and to bend the io bracket this is nvidias job not mine that is literally why i did an rma in the first place why would i risk damaging my unit,0.9874811333138496,0.0,0.2185141742229461,0.525

geforce rtx super founders edition below is the compilation of all the reviews that have been posted so far i will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links this will be sorted alphabetically written articles babeltechreviews the nvidia rtx super is a strong contender in the p gaming market offering substantial improvements over its predecessor and rival amd cards at the same price point while it excels in p performance it is also a viable option for k gaming with some settings adjustments owners of the should keep their cards and we only recommend class series upgrades if you really want the latest and greatest and play games that can take advantage of dlss there is not such a large raw performance upgrade that we can say every user should upgrade but the ai capabilities and class series of upgrades from nvidia could sway you to upgrade cgdirector the rtx super graphics card is nearly an rtx ti without getting all the way there for video editing and motion graphicsanimation workloads im reasonably confident that this card at its msrp will be the best bangforbuck option on shelves for this generation of gpus on the other hand if you need a new gpu for your gpu rendering setup id wait for all the new super graphics cards to launch before pulling the trigger on this one keep your eyes peeled for more slot solutions further up the series line a slot rtx ti super thats nearly an rtx would be a truly super gpu for rendering if youve been holding out for a genuinely significant upgrade over something like an rtx or a the rtx super is an excellent option not only does it finally beat the topend card from nvidias lastgen rtx series but it does so at a somewhat reasonable price that said you should know that nvidias rtx series or whatever theyll call it is slated to launch in a year so if youre happy with the performance youre getting right now you could stick with it for another year however if your work demands faster hardware especially for the workloads we covered above now is as good a time as any for an upgrade dexterto the rtx impressed us upon its release by essentially being a parallel to an rtx with more vram and handy frame generation features however the gpus only foil was that the card didnt match up to performance expectations when it came to generational uplift if you cast your mind back to the rtx series the original matched up to the performance of a ti now the rtx super looks to absolve nvidia of this issue entirely by offering up rtx level performance at an accessible price while our only criticism of the vram capacity remains the rtx super is everything the original card should have been at launch its easy to rake nvidia over the coals when a gpu releases and its not quite as good as everyone expects but you have to equally give team green some credit here the super simply trounces the current competition from the rx xt by offering faster performance allround and dlss s framegeneration features as well as better ray traced performance for a slight premium i get a lot of questions about which gpu people should buy and its always been quite difficult to answer but nvidia has handed the answer to me on a silver platter this is the goto gpu for people looking for the ideal pricetoperformance ratio on the market as it stands you also get heaps of extra nvidia ai software features in broadcast reflex and more no matter if youre looking for a card that can manage adequate k great p or blazing p framerates the rtx super has it all at this midtohighend price point this gpu is simply unbeatable i just wished that it had come out earlier digital foundry article digital foundry video tbd there are many different ways of looking at the rtx supers delivery of price vs performance especially with rt factored into the equation youre looking at a decent performance boosts over the standard rtx which now looks excessively priced at its new pricepoint meanwhile in a world where the rtx ti cost at launch youre usually getting to percent of its performance level with a substantial price cut thats not bad however threeandahalf years from its launch the rtx continues to remind us that value just isnt the same as it was yes the rtx super is cheaper more efficient and has more memory but ultimately the performance increase is variable at worst its like a slightly faster rtx at best its up there with rtx and thats before we factor in dlss frame generation which is a very useful feature on a broader level performance thats in line with rtx ti or rtx isnt bad at all for the pricepoint but amds radeon rx xt continues to be an interesting competitor if you can get it at its msrp it lacks the hardware features that make nvidia so compelling while its rt performance is way behind even so it continues to deliver the goods in terms of rasterisation and the gb complement of framebuffer memory remains a spec point where you cant help but feel nvidia should be doing better so the first super arrival increases value and like the series refresh comes across as the kind of pricing we should have had at launch in terms of competition amds radeon rx xt continues to possess more memory holds up well in rasterisation and obviously costs a lot less to the point where cutting prices on the nonsuper to match it would have been a good idea however in terms of features and overall performance the super is the one to have eteknix would i replace my xxx series card with a super not likely its a small upgrade offering something like fps in a lot of games but there are other improvements to the cooling and efficiency that are welcome too however if you want a more compelling reason to upgrade from the xxx or xxx series of cards or exponentially more so even older cards then this certainly tips the scale in the favour of consumers the card is on average around faster than the rtx and on par with the ti but with a significantly lower cost per frame between the amd xt and the nvidia rtx super its an extremely close race on average with amd coming in around cheaper thats maybe a nobrainer for some but i still think nvidia lead the pack with their scaling frame generation and ray tracing technologies and for some thats worth paying the extra premium gurud the geforce rtx super gb has been released at a retail price of making it a more budgetfriendly option for highend gaming compared to the earlier rtx ti which was priced at this graphics card is designed with features like ray tracing dlss and aipowered assists targeting gamers looking for optimal performance it comes equipped with an increased count of shader cores up from gb of gbps gddrx memory on a bit memory interface and a maximum bandwidth of gbs additionally the rtx super includes rt cores tensor cores tmus and rops it utilizes the same billion transistor counting ad silicon as the rtx ti with out of streaming multiprocessors activated this makes the rtx super a compelling more accessible option for those seeking highend gaming performance boasting a powerful architecture advanced ray tracing capabilities and enhanced dlss technology the geforce rtx super showcases significant improvements in performance compared to it predecessor compared to the radeon series the rtx s ray tracing performance has a bit more stamina making notable advancements in this field additionally with the dlss frame generation technology the gpu can create remarkable visual experiences in games that support it the rtx super is a graphics card that can create waves in the gaming world due to its rendering quality and gaming performance when combined with dlss frame generation the rtx provides a bit more value for the money it is a wellbalanced card that can handle gaming at wqhd and even k resolution although it is targeted towards wqhd compared to amds offerings the nvidia gpu struggles to keep up with the radeon rx xt but has positive aspects like dlss and ray tracing features which work exceptionally well amd cannot match nvidia in this regard the rtx super is an excellent option for gamers who play at uwhd qhd and even uhd monitor resolutions the geforce rtx founder edition graphics card stands out with its very nice performance and visual quality thanks to dls and rt assistance it is also characterized by enhanced power efficiency and lower thermal output positioning it as an excellent energyefficient choice this card is suited for highresolution gaming and demanding creative tasks with its gb of vram being quite satisfactory for most applications in the competitive landscape particularly when comparing it to the radeon rx xt specific capabilities such as ray tracing and dlss areas is where the rtx super shows notable strength conversely the radeon rx xt boasts a faster rasterizer engine and additional l cache presenting it as a formidable alternative however with the rtx priced lower it may offer better value for some users the rtx super seems to align more closely in competition with the radeon xt xt rather than the xt its performance can be likened to that of the rtx series varying according to the benchmarks used aesthetically the founder edition models of the rtx super are visually striking and add to its appeal with the new more dark design the card is capable of handling ultra hd gaming particularly when utilizing features like dlss and frame generation and even supports mild overclocking the geforce rtx founder edition is a respectable option for those seeking performing and a visually appealing graphics card pricing remains a point of friction in the market hot hardware after months of rumors and leaks and nvidias official announcement at ces a couple of weeks back the geforce rtx super was somewhat of a known quantity heading into todays launch we are however impressed overall and think nvidia is going to shake things up with the introduction of its geforce rtx series super gpus the geforce rtx super will be hitting store shelves shortly after you read this with founders edition and similarly configured partner boards commanding an msrp of thats slightly higher than the geforce rtx s introductory price but nearly below the geforce rtx ti radeon rx xt cards are currently for sale in the and radeon rx xt starts around with some models breaking the mark looking back through the numbers the geforce rtx super puts a hurting on the radeon rx xt and often hangs with the radeon rx xt particularly when ray tracing is in the mix at the geforce rtx super is a very solid value in its price segment and puts significant pressure on amd we suspect amd and its partners will have to react somehow especially in terms of radeon rx xt pricing while we tried to show an array of compute rendering encoding graphics and gaming workloads in our testing nvidia offers a ton of additional functionality with the geforce rtx series that must be considered as well from rtx video super resolution to av encoding to aiaccelerated tools for various content creation applications nvidia broadcast and others geforce rtx series cards arent just for gaming the combination of nvidias extensive software support with the geforce rtx supers relatively strong performance and competitive pricing make it a compelling option in its product segment if youre looking for a gpu in this price range the geforce rtx super should be at the top of your short list igors lab the geforce rtx super with the ad is a highly interesting midrange card that no longer has to fear a direct competitor from amd in this super generation until team red brings a slimmeddown and attractively priced rx nonxt to the german market or pumps the rx gre into the normal channel and not just supplies system integrators in terms of efficiency nvidia is once again setting standards by which amd must but currently cannot be measured whether and when the rx without xt or a gre for everyone will come is still written in the stars but gamers live in the here and now and there are simply no alternatives at the moment if you want the complete feature set including highquality super sampling frame generation and ai apart from the outdated display port connection and the still somewhat meagre gb memory expansion for ultra hd i dont see any disadvantages with the geforce rtx super that would speak against this card the price is okay so far if you put it in relation to the performance of the other cards because amd isnt really any cheaper the manufacturers will hardly make any big profits with the msrp cards at least that much i can tell you but they wont starve either much of it is little more than a zerosum game where it only becomes somewhat profitable through the masses kitguru article kitguru video in terms of its gaming performance the super slots between the rtx and the rtx ti though it comes in much closer to the latter than it does the former at p for instance its faster on average than the vanilla but just slower than the ti variant that performance bump is enough to make it faster than the rx xt this time by an margin while it offers more performance than the lastgen rtx gb k gaming isnt out of the question especially if you enable dlss though the super does fare better at p due to its relatively narrow bit memory interface which isnt suited for higher resolutions ray tracing performance also scales similarly at least when comparing the super to the og and the ti it is significantly faster than the rx xt over the eight games we tested with ray tracing enabled to the tune of on average while its in the same class as the rx xtx we already knew nvidia has the edge when it comes to ray tracing performance and that is further confirmed by our testing today interestingly despite performance increasing by about over the original rtx power draw is only higher on average with this new super card and that means it is a touch more efficient than the other xx skus it cant quite match the rtx in terms of performance per watt that remains the most efficient ada gpu weve tested so far but it only widens the gap between the rx xt and its competition whats clear is that if you are in the market for a new gpu things just got that bit better sure the rtx super may not be a revolution in graphics performance but its hard to quibble with an extra performance and increased efficiency all at the same price as the previous product its also fair to point out that the rx xt remains a viable option for those only interested in bang per buck with the rdna gpu still offering the best cost per frame for rasterised p gaming and of course it does offer that extra gb vram many may now be swayed by the super however considering it is faster outright significantly so when it comes to ray tracing performance while also offering support for its superior dlss upscaling technology alongside increased efficiency whatever your priorities theres no doubt the nvidia rtx super is a step in the right direction lets hope this is a sign of things to come lanoc as far as performance goes the new rtx super takes a nice step forward ahead of the original rtx by increasing the core count this translated to a improvement at p in our testing and at k with p and p running into some cpu limited situations with just a watt increase in power usage this also moved the nvidia rtx super founders edition up higher in our performance to wattage charts as well gaming performance was especially effective once i got into rtx and dlss testing which with dlss and dlss combined with frame generation you can see huge performance improvements even in situations where your game is cpu limited the nvidia rtx super founders edition even did well in raster performance compared with amds current generation rx xt but i will talk about that here in a second when we get into pricing the founders edition cooler still kept things running relatively cool even with a little higher tgp and the under load noise performance had the card running surprisingly quiet so nvidia has the nvidia rtx super founders edition starting at an msrp of this is the same price as the original rtx when it launched back in april of for an idea of where that puts it in the market the rx xt from amd can be found in the to range the rtx is now and the rtx ti is in the range there are also a few rx xt options still available as well at the rtx super does outperform the rx xt and the rx xt but you are going to pay more to get that performance adding ray tracing and dlss performance into the mix helps add value as well which as long as the games that you plan on playing support it there is a lot of value to be had ocd article ocd video tbd however the fact remains that the rtx is still a brilliant card its still a fabulous gaming card in all but the most demanding k games if youre on anything from the range or earlier or all but the flagship radeon card this will spank any game you offer up to it additionally the cuda and tensor cores leverage massive rendering potential in either d video encoding or even ai generation tasks it might leave a nasty taste in our mouth but its still incredibly nourishing yes if budgets are tight you should use the introduction of the super and subsequent price drop of the vanilla card to get one of them if you want performance the soontobe ended ti card is still the best bet before you reach the rtx but the rtx super fe is on the shelves and reasonably priced with great performance thus winning our ocd gamers choice award pc perspective while an improvement over the original and generally more so than in this comparison with an overclocked rtx the new geforce rtx super does not always reach the heights that a cuda core increase vs might suggest the card is powered by the same ad gpu albeit a more enabled one but is limited to the bit memory system of the original rtx with gbps memory this means we have the same bandwidth but the new card does have mb of l cache up from mb with the original i still have to wonder how much better this card could have performed with some faster memory and a boost clock bump and if there is some actual overclocking headroom ill be happy to follow up with more testing as it is the geforce rtx super does represent a better value than the original at the same usd price point but the upcoming rtx ti super promises to be a far more interesting entry into the lineup pc world tbd techgage tbd techpowerup averaged over the games in our test suite at p we find the rtx super founders edition faster than the rtx nonsuper which is a pretty substantial improvement for a refreshunlike what intel did with their th gen raptor lake this means that the card is able to match last generations rtx flagship and the gap to rtx ti shrinks to just rtx ti benefits from its higher power limit of w though while amds radeon rx xt was a bit faster than rtx in pure raster scenarios this has changed with the rtx super which is now fasteran important goal that nvidia achieved successfully the gap to rtx is still pretty big with likely the reason why nvidia is launching the rtx ti super and rtx super to cover strategically important points in that segment with these performance numbers rtx super is a perfect match for p with maximum settings you should be able to enable ray tracing in most titles too thanks to modern upscalers even k at solid framerates is in reach with the card just like the other geforce cards rtx super has support for all of nvidias dlss technologies nvidia dlss upscaling dlss frame generation and dlss ray reconstruction on top of that you can enable amd fsr and fsr in games because those technologies work on all gpus from all vendors basically this means that youll be covered in terms of upscaling and frame generation while dlss is definitely the leading solution right now with best game support amd is pushing hard and their frame generation solution will come to several major titles in from a technology perspective dlss is superior because it uses the optical flow hardware unit in ada gpus and nvidia reflex will help bring down the input latency priced at for the rtx super founders edition nvidias new card sells at the same price point as the msrp of rtx nonsuper the nonsuper is getting an official pricecut now but it has been at around months already which means the price cut is just making things official the cheapest rtx nonsuper is currently i suspect that in the coming weeks and months it will drop much closer to it has to because amds rx xt is offering a strong alternative to both the rtx and rtx s especially when you dont care about ray tracing even when considering nonsuper vs super i feel that a lot of people will be tempted to go to for the s or for a performance increase isnt such a bad deal especially in this segment for amd vs nvidia the situation is similar dlss is the green teams biggest selling point super adds more performance on top of that at close enough pricing which aligns with nvidias pricing strategy betting that this is something many people desire still the current gpu market as a whole is far from affordable or tempting it seems that amd is happy with the current situation in which they follow nvidias pricing undercutting them only slightlyno price war in sight given rtx supers positioning and performance and the lower price of rtx nonsuper i suspect that amd will adjust their pricing for rx xt a bit what could really make a difference if they gave rx xt a substantial pricecut but that seems unlikely considering that they never tried to make the card sexy from a pricing perspective and rather opted for close enough to xtx so that people will consider the upsell option for rtx super that means it owns that price point theres no way people will buy a rx xt rx xt or rtx instead of super unless they seriously go down in pricing i guess some dlss naysayers could be tempted by a used sub rtx gb but besides that the only real competition is the rx xt and nvidias own geforce cards the fps review with the launch of the geforce rtx series super gpus you are going to hear a lot of this is what it should have been from the beginning while that can be said it is more nuanced and layered than this nvidia has addressed its segmentation and pricing and is now offering a better priceperformance offering and overall creating a more desirable lineup for its gpus it is certainly a value increase at these price points in our testing the geforce rtx super is a bigger performance uplift from the geforce rtx than rumors were suggesting we are seeing it make a pretty significant difference in performance compared to the geforce rtx the fact that nvidia is giving you more performance at the same price point is positive and a good move it creates a performance and pricing value increase in this price segment from the rtx series lineup overall the geforce rtx super is a better value than the geforce rtx was at there is a decent performance difference between the geforce rtx and geforce rtx super to warrant the differences in pricing now and make it more appealing at there are a lot of nvidia rtx features packed in here which can make the price premium worth it the features are compelling there is stiff competition from the competition in this generation so be sure to check pricing to get the best deals tomshardware if youre in the market for a new graphics card that costs around give or take the rtx super now looks like the best option its not perfect but its a nice step up from the existing its efficient and it provides all of the usual nvidia features but we also said most of these things about the rtx when it first launched and if you werent enticed to upgrade then the super doesnt massively change the underlying prospects given the choice wed take the super at over the rx xt at even though it doesnt have as much memory and all indications are that amd has no intention of launching anything new that will compete with the super the rx xt and xt have already launched while the upcoming rx xt targets the rtx for the highend gaming market the super is arguably the best option right now lets just hope the

any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of

geforce rtx ti super below is the compilation of all the reviews that have been posted so far i will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links this will be sorted alphabetically psa certain msi geforce rtx ti super ventus x vbios causes lower performance than expected written articles babeltechreviews nvidia claimed a increase of the previous model and we did achieve mostly that in our testing with some slightly lower than quoted its obvious this card easily surpasses the original model at the same price and its really close to the original rtx performance point at significantly less than msrp for the rtx this will change soon with the upcoming launch of the rtx super at its lowered price point of the real decision for gamers in our opinion looking for a card at this level is looking for a used rtx or something at this similar price if you are looking for a new card that can compete with the rtx for lower entry cost then this is a good choice digital foundry article tbd digital foundry video tbd eteknix so im going to admit that was painful when looking at performance and analysing the point of our content its easy to get excited when we see an evolutionary jump but thats not the case here its slightly faster and im talking marginally when you look at the specifications this new graphics card is better in every way there are higher core counts there are more rt and tensor cores theres more vram the clock speeds are up and really that should be an indication of a pretty potent performance boost however from our pretty extensive testing thats not really what we see in the real world its a little bit better but does it feel like an upgrade not really if im being honest more vram is nice and does improve the lows but not as much as the fanatics in the internet comment sections would have you believe it would have dlss and other technologies should have seen a boost too but in games like cyberpunk and hogwarts legacy some were up some were down and some were about the same so it is splitting hairs on whether this is better or not not that theres anything wrong with the performance though its still largely a very great card the performance is fantastic but it just feels like something may be missing i hope and honestly largely expect that this will improve with a few driver updates as things always do i suspect in a few weeks or a couple of months the super variants will have a bigger lead on the nonsuper cards they are replacing what i do like about both the gigabyte and innod cards is the cooler upgrades gigabyte has honed its windforce designs over the years and innod has a greatlooking product too with a slot form factor having a premium quality cooler on this chipset showed that it can run nice and cool and quiet while still delivering great performance overall so overall the ti super can be taken one of two ways if youre already rocking a ti then there is no reason to change to a ti super and if you want more performance then you need to be looking at levels or above but even then id personally wait for the super to see what that brings though i fear it could be the same levels as what we saw today if however youre on something older and your heart was set on a ti then obviously it makes sense to pay the same and get a ti super though id seriously be questioning how much extra performance youre going to be gaining over what you already have gurud the data speaks for itself key factors here are gaming performance and rendering quality indeed the rtx ti super offers better value for money compared to the this card is approaching the raw performance required for gaming at k resolution it caters specifically to enthusiast gamers who typically use monitors with uwhd qhd or uhd resolutions making it an ideal choice for that demographic the rasterizer engine in the rtx series significantly surpasses the performance capabilities of its predecessors this series introduces a new generation of more potent ray tracing and tensor cores raw counts of rt and tensor cores are not the sole indicators of performance rather the effectiveness of each unit is key these cores are positioned near the shader engine enhancing their efficiency a fact that is evident in their performance while tensor cores impact is more challenging to quantify the impressive results observed especially with dlss indicate their robust performance the geforce rtx ti demonstrates its strength across various resolutions performing effectively from k x to k x overall the geforce rtx ti super delivers a robust gaming experience and when comparing it directly to similar gpus it surpasses the performance range of the ti and is close to the rtx with some variability in a broader context when comparing it to other gpus like the radeon rx xt and xtxtx a complex decisionmaking process ensues the choice between the ti super and xtx hinges on several factors the rtx ti super excels in ray tracing performance and boasts the added benefit of dlss and at many levels is on par with more than cards looking at team red the xt exhibits a slight advantage in rasterizer engine performance supported by its additional l cache the gb of vram offered by the ti super is sufficient for most current titles especially when playing at ultra hd resolutions powered by the ada gpu architecture this card delivers precision and competence in gaming the substantial increase in shader cores translates to nearly times the raw shader performance resulting in faster ray tracing and improved tensor core performance underlying technologies such as shader execution reordering ser and dlss contribute to the excellence of the new product and the series overall in conclusion the geforce rtx ti super leaves a notable impression and is sure to please gamers but it comes at a considerable cost despite its commendable performanceperwatt ratio its energy consumption levels remain relatively high this graphics card is capable of handling ultra hd gaming smoothly particularly when enhanced with dlss frame generation and offers the possibility of a moderate overclock the tuf gaming version of the geforce rtx ti super offers an appealing choice for users who value a quiet performance and visual appeal in their pc gaming setup the model we tested today which is the nonoverclocked nonoc version is priced at the manufacturers suggested retail price msrp of for retail purchase hot hardware at this point nvidias blueprint with the geforce rtx super series is clear boost performance at similar or lower introductory prices to enhance the overall value of the lineup the asus tuf geforce rtx ti super arrives at the same price point of its predecessor but offers more cores more video memory and ultimately more performance across every workload the asus tuf geforce rtx ti super cant quite catch the geforce rtx bit it comes close in many tests for a couple of hundred bucks less with recent price cuts the radeon rx x is being offered for about looking back through the numbers that price adjustment is just about inline with its performance relative to the asus tuf geforce rtx ti super if you factor in ray tracing in games that dont make extensive use of ray tracing and mostly rely on traditional rasterization techniques the radeon rx xt may pull ahead of the rtx ti super todays gpus are about much more than gaming however looking at the content creation rendering and other compute tests and the asus tuf geforce rtx ti super outpaces the radeons ultimately the geforce rtx ti super represents additional value for gamers and creators it arrives at the same price point as its predecessor but effectively offers more of everything if youve got the budget and are looking for a gpu its price category the geforce rtx ti super is the card to beat right now and asus tuf model ticks many of the right boxes igors lab the geforce rtx ti super is an excellent card in wqhd when it comes to the highest frame rates and is also quite suitable for ultra hd at the latest then however you will have to think about smart upscaling in places and this is where dlss and frame generation come into play meanwhile games such as the last of us part tlou look subjectively even better in ultra hd with dlss than native ultra hd this is where nvidia can really play to its advantages which dlss x and above all dlss also offer in purely visual terms however if a game also supports frame generation and you would still be bobbing around in the less playable fps range even with super sampling then this can even be a lifeline to good playability you cant improve the latency with it but not every genre is as latencybound as various shooters i would have really liked dlss for tlou but you cant have everything from this point of view the geforce rtx ti super completely fulfills all expectations based on the data already published all the ai including the appropriate programs dlss frame generation and the often better latencies are also good arguments if it werent for the current dumping by amd which should be just right for the customer the geforce rtx ti super with the ada is a thoroughly interesting upper midrange card but nothing more at the moment especially in view of the amd radeon rx xt and the current price difference it wont sell for the really good features but rather only for the street price apart from the outdated display port connection i dont see any disadvantages at all with the geforce rtx ti super that would speak against this card only the price has just been badly undermined by the competitor we will have to wait and see whether the socalled oc cards justify the additional price after all msi has shown with the ventus x that even the msrp card can almost perfectly convert the additional performance of the significantly increased number of shaders into adequate gaming performance kitguru article kitguru video ultimately the rtx ti super is about as good as i was expecting considering the bump in core count and the switch to gigs of memory over a bit interface i will certainly be interested to see how other models compare as if the ventus x really is slower than what the ti super should be then thats only a further positive for the new gpu as a whole of course i can only base my conclusions on what we have tested but even then this is a strong refresh and a gpu thats well worth buying i do believe the rx xt remains a credible option if rasterised gaming is your top priority as it is still slightly faster overall while some strategically timed cutprice deals only increase the value proposition that said i think if you are spending on a new graphics card chances are you will be tempted by the superior ray tracing performance dlss support and increased efficiency of the rtx ti super lanoc as for its performance the rtx ti super has more cuda cores and nvidia has also increased the video memory up from gb to gb which should help at high resolutions and help keep the card relevant in the future for longer in my testing this translated to a increase in performance depending on the testing in game at p it was faster than the overclocked tuf gaming rtx ti that i tested previously but at k this ramped up to and i saw similar numbers in synthetic benchmarks like time spy and time spy extreme which it improved on time spy and on time spy extreme this helped it catch up with amds rx xt especially at k but the xt was on average still fps faster at p where the xt didnt keep up was with ray tracing performance and once you figure in dlss which the games you are playing support it is a huge improvement the performance improvement also helped with overall efficiency while it has the same tgp our tuf gaming rtx ti super did pull a hair more than our overclocked tuf gaming rtx ti did for power but with the performance improvement its already great power to performance was even better the cooler for the tuf gaming rtx ti super ran surprisingly quiet in my testing as well and while i wouldnt say the cooling performance was the best it did perform well keeping the card more than cool enough which when combined with how quiet it was would make me happy as for pricing the tuf gaming rtx ti super is launching at the rtx ti super launch msrp of this fits right in at the same msrp as last years rtx ti which is it replacing there arent any game partnerships right now however which is a bummer given that amds rx xt does come with avatars frontiers or pandora amd did also just recently dropped the pricing on a few of their cards including the xt which now has an msrp of in response to nvidias super cards announcement this does put the xt as the better value if you are looking only at raster performance but i do think that the ray tracing and dlss performance have a lot of value as well and that difference still makes this a good pickup if you are looking for highend performance without spending rtx or rx xtx numbers the tuf gaming rtx ti super specifically is looking especially appealing this time around given that there isnt a founders edition for this gpu and its allmetal construction asus does have an overclocked model as well which will hit stores at and a white overclocked tuf model for they will also have a pro art card for that same price point and then a strix model as well which has a hefty price point which is way too close to the announced msrp of the rtx super in my opinion ocd article tbd ocd video tbd pc perspective this was a refreshing review not just because the rtx ti has been refreshed and is now super for the same price but because it really lives up to the super branding with doubledigit gains over its predecessor this card is being neatly dropped in to the same price slot as its predecessor bringing quite a bit of rtx dna along with it you know its like nvidia was holding out on us they could have released the rtx ti in this ad configuration with this level of performance all along if they really wanted to it would have made the original price tag a lot more palatable or maybe they were playing chess and now that weve accepted this price level theyre bringing performance in line with expectations i think im babbling at this point bottom line the new geforce rtx ti super isnt just the first card in nvidias history to be both a ti and a super at the same time its a solid performer with a significantly better priceperformance ratio than its predecessor we cant argue with that and once you factor in ray tracing performance dlss and frame generation if youre into that sort of thing at this is a lot of gpu in the current market pc world tbd techgage tbd techpowerup with these performance numbers rtx ti super is a perfect match for p with maximum settings its actually slightly overkill which means that the card is a decent option for k monitors too or for p at hz while you wont be able to game at k at highest settings just dropping them down a bit should help get those frames and theres always the various upscaling technologies especially if you plan on enabling ray tracing just like the other geforce cards rtx ti super has support for all of nvidias dlss technologies nvidia dlss upscaling dlss frame generation and dlss ray reconstruction on top of that you can enable amd fsr and fsr in games because those technologies work on all gpus from all vendors basically this means that youll be covered in terms of upscaling and frame generation while dlss is definitely the leading solution right now with best game support amd is pushing hard and their frame generation solution will come to several major titles in from a technology perspective dlss is superior because it uses the optical flow hardware unit in ada gpus and nvidia reflex will help bring down the input latency the biggest selling point of the rtx ti super vs the rtx ti nonsuper is the increased vram size of gb rtx tis gb vram size has been a constant topic for debate on tech forums so it makes a lot of sense that nvidia is giving us a gb option now and at pretty reasonable pricing unlike rtx ti gb unlike more cores or higher clocks more vram will not make all games run faster automatically across all the game tests raster rt x resolutions we only identified two cases where gb results in a meaningful improvement over gb the last of us k and alan wake rt at k no doubt you will be able to find more such results with other titles too but the vast majority of games out there will not see any meaningful improvement from the gb upgrade im sure that this will change in the coming years with more and more games increasing their vram requirements but i dont think that a gb card will suddenly turn out to be useless in and you also have to consider that as soon as you enable upscaling the actual render resolution is reduced which lowers the vram usage significantly still given all the drama about gb vrampeople can finally put their money where their mouth is and grab the rtx ti super gb a secondary effect of the gb vram capacity is that the bus width is increased from bit to bit or this is required because to achieve gb you need to install eight gb memory chips each having a bit interface to the gpu with just gb and six chips a bit interface is sufficient x this increase in bus width leads to an equivalent increase in memory bandwidth which should help provide an additional performance boost looking at my data im not so convinced while the card does have slightly better scaling than rtx ti gb the rtx is still able to pull away at higher res it seems that what matters more for performance scaling is the l cache size and not the vram bus width unfortunately nvidia did limit the ti super to mb l cache while the rtx gets the full mb as expected ray tracing works very well on the geforce rtx ti super clearly offering a superior experience than what radeon rx xt and often even rx xtx can achieve on average the rtx ti super offers higher fps with rt than rx xt which is quite a bit nvidias new card also shows better rt performance numbers than rx xtx in most gamesif youre betting on ray tracing then definitely opt for the rtx ti super that doesnt mean that rt is unusable on amd its just running considerably slower because their cards are lacking dedicated hardware units to accelerate rt operations the fps review overall when it comes to rasterized gaming without ray tracing the new geforce rtx ti super is around faster than the geforce rtx ti this was the common number we experienced mostly without ray tracing when ray tracing was used this percentage number crept up slightly with ray tracing the geforce rtx ti super was more like faster with some outliers like alan wake there are of course games where the percentages were lower around or maybe even some under as you lower the resolution the highest differences were at k or with ray tracing looking at performance compared to the radeon rx xt is more mixed the radeon rx xt put up a competitive fight and in many games was as fast as the geforce rtx ti super or faster when looking at raster performance without ray tracing the radeon rx xt is compelling in its performance by comparison and this was at k and p more often than not there were standout games like starfield or cyberpunk or returnal or dying light where the radeon rx xt seemed to get the edge on the geforce rtx ti super even in alan wake performance was equal between the cards delivering the same experience the one sore spot for the radeon rx xt is once again ray tracing this is going to be game dependent and also depend on the types of ray tracing effects used and how heavily implemented they are the geforce rtx ti super has a huge lead in path tracing performance as is shown in alan wake and cyberpunk overall the geforce rtx ti super is going to deliver much higher ray tracing performance in games in some circumstances you can use upscaling fsr on the radeon rx xt to make it playable but this brings up the image quality of fsr at p that is an advantage the geforce rtx ti super has dlss and rtx features when the going gets tough on the geforce rtx ti super with ray tracing you can also use upscaling on it with dlss overall dlss has superior image quality to fsr at lower resolutions like p you will more likely want to use dlss on the geforce rtx ti super than you would want to use fsr on the radeon rx xt at p if you also want to get good ray tracing image quality the geforce rtx ti super also has dlss ray reconstruction support to improve ray tracing image quality in games that support it like alan wake and cyberpunk its ray tracing image quality is unmatched tomshardware this isnt a generously priced graphics card in other words and by raising the msrp nvidia probably took a more sizeable cut from its aib partners still its certainly better than paying the same for the rtx ti which is probably why the base price on those cards has fallen to around and weve seen sales push the price as low as which is still arguably too high is the rtx ti super worth the asking price that depends on what you want to do with it relative to amds rx xt even at its current promotional pricing starting at you can certainly make arguments in favor of nvidias gpu its more power efficient is potentially better equipped for future games if ray tracing adoption picks up offers access to nvidias proprietary dlss features including frame generation and you get superior ai performance if all you care about is rasterization performance amds xt comes out ahead and offers a better value and there are hundreds of new rasterizationonly games released every year but if you value any of those other extras even if you only think you might want to try them nvidia has cards at every price point that are worth a look ultimately the rtx ti super provides some worthwhile improvements over its nonsuper predecessor if youre in the market for a highend nvidia gpu and you havent upgraded in a few years its a great card just dont be surprised when nextgeneration gpus come out in a year or so that have even more new features improved performance and just maybe not a massive generational price increase we can dream

driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer program with free sdks stateoftheart deep learning courses certification and access to expert help sound interesting learn more

bbbnnnnnnnh below is the compilation of all the reviews that have been posted so far i will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links this will be sorted alphabetically written articles babeltechreviews though slightly underwhelming its worth noting that the rtx super remains an excellent card for gaming when it comes to pure rasterization the amd radeon rx xtx may lead by a slim margin we do not have one to test but the super compensates with far better rt performance nonetheless nvidia has utilized the full potential of the gpu avoiding any limitations on its units although higher clock speeds and power limits might have yielded additional albeit small improvements there is zero reason to consider a rtx at this time if there is a steep sale with remaining stock or a used card you may find success there and will not miss out on much we are very surprised that the rtx super mostly ends up at on average over the rtx fe now that nvidias super refreshes are complete we still believe the rtx super is the card of choice for of gamers if you must have the latest and greatest or an xt digital foundry article digital foundry video tbd in performance terms theres a law of diminishing returns to the excitement level surrounding the arrival of each new super from the generally positive reaction to the rtx super to the more muted response to the rtx ti super and now ambivalence with the super improvement the truth is its a pricing adjustment dressed up in a marketing announcement and this is generally fine overall but how much of a value enhancement are we actually getting the cost per frame values for the s predecessor rtx are normalised so while relative value only slightly tips towards the rtx super at least were looking at something fairer in effect this looks very much like the kind of topend pricing that the rtx should have had at launch if youre looking for proportionately better value the super is clearly worth taking a look at based on the table above theres one more thing id like to point out though we cant ignore that reaching a certain performance threshold makes more experiences viable especially at k resolution and that may be worth paying the premium pathtraced alan wake and cyberpunk are doing things that the rx xtx never will its that simple dlss spatial upscaling dlss frame generation temporal upscaling dlss ray reconstruction theyre combining to make special things happen ultimately i cant help but think that if youre dropping a grand on a new gpu you should have access to toptier experiences at k resolution amds value is clear and present but i think this is all worth taking into consideration in the gallery above youll note that even on a toptier amd sponsored game avatar frontiers of pandora the rtx super is ahead of the rx xtx and dlss quality mode is delivering improved image quality over its fsr equivalent in summary then rtx super does what it needs to do in delivering the kind of priceperformancefeatures we didnt get at launch similar to the rtx ti super it feels like the kind of package it should have been back in the day expensive but not egregiously so the price is improved then but it arrives months on from the s launch and while there is a slightly better level of proportionate value compared to the rightly celebrated rtx its still hard not to feel that this is still a pretty steep asking price for an class product at least now there is a gap for a ti but with the ai boom it does feel less likely well ever get one eteknix so what do we think i think its clear to see that the super is a step up in everything but performance sure some games can utilise the extra specs that the super has but at such a small amount its still within the margin of error and the silicon lottery comes into play too so you could argue why didnt nvidia just price cut the and while theyve not confirmed anything with us we do have our theories when nvidia place an order for the silicon from their partners they are paying a specific price based on the fabrication process and the nonsuper never saw that change whereas the super is slightly different as per the gpu variants naming structure so nvidia has found a way to refine the process and in turn its likely costing them less money their costs go down and therefore they can afford to pass those savings on whereas simply cutting the price of an existing product thats been made under a more expensive fab process and has already been paid for is a completely different kettle of fish so im all for this and like i said earlier it does seem that gamers are happy to pay more for an nvidia card as seen by how much of the market nvidia have and the fact that amd has even been rumoured to say that they may stop making highend gpus much like we saw with the series which topped out as the series they simply cant compete thats not to say in terms of rasterisation high frame rate numbers but more in terms of features and of course ray tracing so that all puts nvidia in a really good position and allows them yes to charge more money but also to do these midcycle changes where money and savings can be passed on sure wed all like to see it cheaper but the super is still likely to outsell both the xt and xtx by a huge margin much like the more expensive nonsuper already has so definitely some food for thought i always had my feelings about how the was too expensive but at its definitely a card that really has no competition when you factor in all elements including performance ray tracing upscaling streaming and all of the other features that separate amd and nvidia gurud the performance metrics are clear the geforce rtx series yes both and super stands out particularly in gaming performance and rendering quality this card offers better value compared to the achieving highlevel performance that facilitates k resolution gaming its ideal for enthusiast gamers who use ultrawide hd uwhd quad hd qhd or ultra hd uhd monitors the rtx features an advanced rasterizer engine that surpasses previous performance limits thanks in part to its k shading processors additionally the rtx series introduced a new generation of ray tracing and tensor cores which have proven to be significantly more powerful the core counts of rt and tensor should not be the sole focus their performance efficiency is what truly matters located near the shader engine these cores have become more efficient a fact that is evident in their output while tensor cores are often challenging to quantify our observations indicate robust performance as evidenced by the impressive results with dlss technology the geforce rtx is versatile delivering super performance pardon the pun at resolutions ranging from k x to k x heres the reality for the geforce rtx super its hardware and performance are commendable but the performance differential towards the existing rtx is often within a baseline eg close to nothing while it has more shaders and faster memory both cards are tied towards the very same w tgp mainly resulting in that close to nil performance differential the biggest benefit of the series thus is pricing the ada gpu architecture of the super demonstrates proficient performance it boasts about times the raw shader performance compared to its predecessors along with enhanced raytracing and tensor core capabilities technologies like shader execution reordering ser and dlss further enhance the capabilities of the series making it a standout product add to that features like dlss with ray reconstruction and frame generation and you are bound to be able to use this graphics card for years the geforce rtx is notable for its impressive performance numbers it is particularly suitable for gamers who use ultra hd or have a minimum monitor resolution of x for those who can afford it the super is a valuable addition to any highend gaming setup for instance games like microsoft flight simulator when combined with dlss achieve over fps at high resolutions similarly cyberpunk in uhd raytracing and dlss exceeds fps the recent move towards ray reconstruction also moved nvida into that sweet spot the card excels in ultra hd gaming whether using standard shading or a combination of hybrid raytracing and dlss the super at is now more affordable than the it still represents a significant financial commitment offering a very nice performance hot hardware nvidia set out to do a few things with its geforce rtx super lineup the ultimate goals were to improve performance refresh its founders edition boards with a fresh aesthetic and offer more value to gamers with reduced introductory price points versus the original models although the performance deltas separating the geforce rtx super from the original rtx are relatively small in comparison to the rtx and ti supers it is still faster than the original the geforce rtx super also arrives with a msrp below the rtx s introductory price a cool grand is not chump change of course but more performance at a lower price point is a good thing and we have to give kudos to nvidia for the move the geforce rtx super may also put some additional pressure on amd reference clocked radeon rx xtx cards can be found for about as of this publication which may or may not require adjustment depending on your point of view the geforce rtx super is faster overall for only slightly more money assuming street prices actually hit msrp the radeon rx xtx will likely be faster with many titles that dont use ray tracing but the scales tip in favor of the geforce rtx super once ray tracing is factored into the mix many rendering and compute workloads also perform better on the geforce rtx super and the geforce is more power efficient too well have to see how things shake out in the next few weeks but amd may want to run some promos at the very least to improve the radeon rx xtxs current value proposition in light of todays launch in the end nvidias brought its second fastest gpu down into the sub price bracket thats not cheap but its a positive development nonetheless and we welcome it the geforce rtx super is fast power efficient we dig the allblack aesthetic and it is ultimately a better value for enthusiasts shopping for a highend gpu igors lab how do you make a product cheaper and more attractive without directly lowering the price and entering into a price war that you cant and dont want to win you create a superadequate product even add some performance on top sacrifice some efficiency but can use significantly more chips in order to significantly reduce the price the result is a new improved recipe that is even cheaper than the new products from the relevant food companies and with more content well a few calories will be added to the price but thats peanuts compared to the purchase price what sounds like the reverse of the daily criticism of cheat packs in the shops is certainly also calculated in over a year nvidia has certainly collected enough chips for the geforce rtx super and at the same time increased the yield to proudly position this product as a replacement for the geforce rtx nonsuper an average of to percent more performance compared to the nonsuper card with a good more shaders doesnt sound so exhilarating but at least the range outside any measurement tolerances can be proven of course things that were previously unplayable are not suddenly playable but it is at least a certain benefit that customers are happy to accept especially as the price of the socalled rrp cards has fallen significantly however the board partners come into play again at this party and if you want something nicer and brighter the price can quickly rise by to euros then the advantage is gone again and you will have to think about where to set your priorities the first impression of the geforce rtx super is therefore quite positive for the first time in a long time nvidia is once again offering a card that is cheaper than the older comparison model and still remains at the top of the field in terms of efficiency the approximately percentage points compared to an even slightly slower geforce rtx ti are still shockingly high and they also show what the ada generation is capable of even if you open the tap a little further kitguru article kitguru video as the last of three rtx series super launches this month there is no doubt the nvidia rtx super is the least interesting of the lot for the simple reason that it brings no tangible performance benefit over the outgoing rtx the refreshes started strongly with the rtx super coming in a good faster than the while the rtx ti super delivers performance thats a bit faster than the rtx ti but with vram and memory bandwidth increased by a third today weve assessed the rtx super and found it to be faster than the rtx thats right across twelve games at k resolution the rtx super came in faster on average nine of the twelve games tested showed a difference of less than while we saw a performance increase of more than in just a single game the differences are so marginal that the silicon lottery could well mean a higherperforming rtx would actually outperform a slightly belowpar rtx super and in fact thats exactly what we did find in our review of the palit jetstream oc as lame as that is its important to remember we are still talking about a very fast gpu here it may be an entirely uninteresting difference compared to the original but it is nonetheless a very capable k card averaging fps across the twelve games tested it is also second only to the rtx when looking at ray tracing admittedly by quite a distance but the reality is amd has nothing that can compete in this segment if you value rt performance given the super proved faster than the xtx over the eight ray traced games we tested clearly the rtx super is all about the new lower pricepoint rather than the almost nonexistent performance improvements over the rtx as a reminder rtx launched in november for while the super is now hitting the market at offering the same performance for a price thats lower doesnt sound too bad and it does improve the cost per frame by over the rtx when looking at the launch msrps lanoc as far as the super goes nvidia did improve on the performance we saw with the rtx but this isnt a huge step up in performance between the two cards i saw an average of improvement in our k gaming tests and in some of the synthetic tests i saw less and other tests i saw up to this did help it catch up to the rx xtx at p and p but the xtx was still a few fps higher at k that is before we figure in dlss with frame generation and the overall ray tracing capabilities of the rtx super founders edition which were both a big plus for the super for power efficiency the rtx super founders edition did drop down slightly compared to the original rtx but it was still in a different class compared to the competition from amd the rtx super founders edition impressed in our noise testing especially when under load and its cooling performance was better than i expected as well the only downside there is that there isnt much headroom in the cooler when it comes to cranking the fans up but as it sits i wouldnt have any reason to want to do that anyhow in the end like always it comes down to pricing nvidia has the rtx super priced with an msrp of and the rtx super founders edition because it comes from them directly will be at that price point the rtx that this replaces launched at while the rtx super founders edition isnt a drastic step forward in performance it does offer a step up while coming down most people myself included werent a fan of the pricing of the rtx last year but i can say without a doubt that the rtx super and the rtx super founders edition with it is what the original rtx should have been a capable performer and while not cheap you are getting highlevel performance at a price that fits that is competitive the rx xtx is right in that same price range right now and while the raster performance of the xtx was a touch higher than the super at k nvidias tech like dlss and its ray tracing capabilities help add a lot of value and push me into the super camp neoseeker the colorful geforce rtx super ultra w oc is a champion at p while remaining very capable at k with extreme quality settings as long as you dont expect extreme frame rates on demanding games games are still definitely playable at k with mostly maximum settings with averages around fps especially if you leverage nvidia dlss technology the colorful geforce rtx super ultra w oc operated very quietly at both stock and turbo preset frequencies and was still able to overclock extremely well the triple mm dual ball bearing fans were a great match for the large heat sink cooler and they ran quietly until forced to run at high speeds the cooler has five mm heat pipes and two mm heat pipes that are soldered to the fins and worked very well under load the colorful igame software also worked well in both full and lite versions reflecting my system hardware properties and rgb settings correctly if you want one of the best graphics cards out on the market that is still within reach be sure to check out the colorful geforce rtx super ultra w oc ocd article ocd video summing up this whole nvidia refresh has been akin to trying to nail a jelly to the wall theoretically easy hard in practise with the rtx super we felt it was a victim of previous nvidia decisions about their product range and pricing more recently the rtx ti we felt was fast enough to justify the super tag but affordable enough to not be offensive today with the rtx super we have nothing but good things to say firstly we like how nvidia have beefed up the hardware clock speed increases arent enough to justify a new model by giving us more hardware it makes the product more palatable secondly there wasnt a rtx ti so the range was less muddled to begin with it gives the rtx super a place in their range above the vanilla card below the rtx easy thirdly the extra clock speed and extra hardware have combined to bring more performance to the table by pricing the super aggressively under a thousand pounds it brings gaming to the enthusiast without breaking the bank pc perspective there you have it another super launch is in the books and we have a very slight performance edge over the original version of the card when comparing the new rtx series super cards by far this is the smallest performance uplift compared to the original however this card is nearly less expensive than the version it is replacing when does this ever happen im sure top youtubers are already out there with their pensive disapproving disappointed or pseudoangry face thumbnails just killing the low singledigit increases with the rtx super over its nonsuper predecessor but to me this launch is all about the benjamins all two of them as a matter of fact yes for united states dollars less than the original card you have a new card thats just a little faster the end pc world while i couldnt recommend the original rtx over the radeon rx xtx at its chestclutching price the geforce rtx supers price tag makes it much more competitive in fact id opt for nvidias refreshed penultimate gpu over amds champion now the performance upgrades in the super are perfunctory and negligible its the price drop that matters the super and the xtx both deliver screamingfast frame rates in traditional games trading blows left and right thats what made the radeon so appealing versus the original especially with nvidias card having such an exorbitant markup but by matching the xtxs msrp nvidias extras help the super claim dominance the geforce rtx draws massively less power than its amd rival to deliver similar frame rates in traditional games flip on ray tracing and nvidia holds a gargantuan lead with stellar aipowered features like dlss frame generation and ray reconstruction pushing both speed and performance advantages to features like nvidia broadcast and reflex hold deep practical appeal rtx video super resolution uses ai to make ugly videos beautiful and nvidia maintains a strong lead in most creative and machine learningai workloads if you like to put your gpu to work when youre not playing witness the dual av encoders in the super taken as a whole package performance ray tracing power efficiency features even prosumer tasks nvidias geforce rtx super is the clear choice in its price range this is the graphics card you want for k gaming without going over you can often find the radeon xtx on sale for or so but id still pick up the super without hesitation given that option at the highend where everything matters i wouldnt consider the amd option unless it was on sale for or ideally less despite it being a fine k gpu in its own right if you want k gaming excellent ray tracing and nvidia features at a slightly lesser price the geforce rtx ti super is also worth considering now that it has gb of memory and a wider memory bus it isnt as fast as the obviously but should still get the job done or if you want the ultimate gaming experience theres always the geforce rtx though its priced at and going for closer to on the street techgage tbd techpowerup averaged over the games in our test suite at k we find the card only faster than nonsuper founders edition which is much less than expected while nvidia never said i definitely expected more its not a power limit issue running at max power yields another only these numbers are pretty constant across resolutions and even with rt enabled too looking at the individual games the differences are or fps nothing youd ever notice subjectively while thats certainly a bit disappointing the fact remains that rtx super just like the rtx nonsuper is a fantastic card for gaming in a pure raster scenario the amd radeon rx xtx is still a tiny bit faster but nvidias card makes up for that with much better rt performance still i feel like beating the xtx across the board was one of the goals of rtx super and nvidia failed here in nvidias defense the rtx super leverages the full gpu no units were held back even though small additional gains could have been achieved with higher clock speeds and power limit compared to the rtx ti super the performance uplift is the card is also faster than rtx ti nonsuper rtx ti performance is roughly comparable to rtx which makes the genovergen uplift a very solid nvidias flagship the rtx is still the undisputed king of the hill offering almost better performance taking a closer look at our test results most of the games are in the rangeits not that one game is and the others are the gains are really small across the board there is definitely some variations in gpu chip silicon quality which affects performance due to the way nvidias boost algorithm works but with my sample size of cards tested i think that i can confidently say that theres no way youre getting out of the super unless you manually overclock it other reviewers have similar numbers so its not just me surprisingly the rtx super initially considered the least exciting among the new releases on forums showed the highest performance increase in contrast the rtx ti super despite receiving a gpu upgrade and a memory bandwidth increase only saw a modest in extra performance todays release could almost be labeled a rebrand but the improved pricing certainly adds to its appeal nvidia has set an msrp of for the rtx super and thats the real innovation here compared to the current for the rtx nonsuper this introduces a significant discount i have to applaud nvidia for that especially considering that theres not much competition in this segment amd is happy with their price point for the xtx but that changes today rtx super at means that rx xtx becomes unsellable unless its price is lowered considerably the rtx super offers superior rt performance similar raster perf and support for dlssexactly what people in the premium segment are looking for even at im not sure if id prefer xtx over a super its just a delta still is definitely not a steal for the rtx super and what it offersthe gpu market is still expensive if you want to save a bit of money probably the most interesting alternative is rx xt which currently sells for but is considerably slower which means lower detail settings or upscaling but theres no dlss on the card to help with that nvidia has confirmed that the rtx nonsuper is now endoflife you could potentially get a card at a good price anything and below is what id call interesting if its higher go for the super model also for its better resale value if you really must have the best then the rtx is what you wantthat hasnt changed with the release of the rtx super but be prepared to pay for it for an almost increase in performance is tough at the end of the day rtx super is disappointing in terms of the changes it brings but it redeems itself thanks to its greatly improved pricing while im sure there will be a lot of drama about the minimal gains what the gpu market really needs is lower prices not marginally better performance for the same price in this regard the rtx super can be considered a success the fps review tbd tomshardware nvidias rtx super can be summed up in just a few words its like the rtx only less expensive thats not to say its inexpensive as it still costs over after taxes but cheaper is at least something meanwhile the performance side of the story is a gigantic snorefest the rtx super does technically offer more performance than the rtx but only by about percent on average even a piddly overclock of an rtx could improve performance at least that much if you were on the fence and trying to decide between amds rx xtx and nvidias rtx with the latter costing on average extra the rtx super effectively wipes away the price difference the only real reason to opt for a xtx now barring any price cuts is if you specifically want amds top card or you want any gpu that has more than gb of memory otherwise the rtx super is almost always the better option yes there are exceptions like a few rasterization games and certain professional applications as well as workloads that need more than gb but less than gb of vram if youre specifically interested in one of those use cases thats fine and amd is still technically about cheaper for the least expensive xtx cards at the same time you give up access to nvidias dlss features and potentially lose a lot of performance in other use cases in other words you win in a few specific cases and lose in a lot of other situations ultimately the rtx super delivered precisely what we expected to see its a cheaper and barely faster take on the rtx the price means its now in direct competition with amds xtx but either one still costs as much as an entire midrange gaming pc its fine for what it is but doesnt offer anything new other than a stealthier black aesthetic for the founders edition if youre in the market for a toptier graphics card and cant justify doubling the price and picking up an rtx the rtx super now ranks as the second fastest gpu overall and its cheaper than the existing its slightly faster and less costly than the but we were never particularly pleased with the launch price of the in the first place represents a welcome and necessary price correction and unlike the rtx which was generally selling at over for the majority of its life cycle the super should at least be readily available computerbase german hardwareluxx

driver release notes nvidia driver forum for feedback link here submit driver feedback directly to nvidia link here rodrogs driver benchmark tbd rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know

nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer program with free sdks stateoftheart deep learning courses

notes nvidia driver forum for feedback driver forum link submit driver feedback directly to nvidia link here rodrogs driver benchmark tbd rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has

feedback driver forum link submit driver feedback directly to nvidia link here rodrogs driver benchmark tbd rnvidia discord driver feedback invite link here having issues with your driver read here before you start make sure you submit feedback for your nvidia driver issue there is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved and thats if the driver team at nvidia knows what those problems are so in order for them to know whats going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to submit feedback to nvidia a guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found here additionally if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread reply and mention you are having the same issue the more people that are affected by a particular bug the higher the priority that bug will receive from nvidia common troubleshooting steps be sure you are on the latest build of windows or please visit the following link for ddu guide which contains full detailed information on how to do fresh driver install if your driver still crashes after ddu reinstall try going to go to nvidia control panel managed d settings power management mode prefer maximum performance if it still crashes we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable proceed below at your own risk a lot of driver crashing is caused by windows tdr issue there is a huge post on geforce forum about this here this post dated back to thanks microsoft and it can affect both nvidia and amd cards unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so its difficult to pin down however editing the windows registry might solve the problem additionally there is also a tool made by wagnard maker of ddu that can be used to change this tdr value download here note that i have not personally tested this tool if you are still having issue at this point visit geforce forum for support or contact your manufacturer for rma common questions is it safe to upgrade to fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations the only way to know is to try it yourself my rule of thumb is to wait a few days if theres no confirmed widespread issue i would try the new driver bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on reddit or forums unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue chances are they are fine try it yourself and you can always ddu and reinstall old driver if needed my color is washed out after upgradinginstalling driver help try going to the nvidia control panel change resolution scroll all the way down output dynamic range full my game is stuttering when processing physics calculation try going to the nvidia control panel and to the surround and physx settings and ensure the physx processor is set to your gpu what does the new power management option optimal power means how does this differ from adaptive the new power management mode is related to what was said in the geforce gtx keynote video to further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen the driver will not make the gpu render a new frame the driver will get the one already rendered frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor remember driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations the software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people for a more comprehensive list of open issues please take a look at the release notes again i encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here good or bad did you know nvidia has a developer program with free sdks stateoftheart deep learning courses certification and access to expert help sound interesting learn more here,0.9721185266971588,0.0,-0.3123382227495312,0.9935
