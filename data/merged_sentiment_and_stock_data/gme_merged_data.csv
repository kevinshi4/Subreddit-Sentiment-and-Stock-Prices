warning lots of reading here scroll to the bottom for tldr im a helpful person sometimes too helpful now this is where my patience gets tested child visits grandparent as a guardian when mother isnt available they live in different neighboring states the grandparent is giving their child the ability to play some games okay its fortnite and roblox kids loves these games they both come into the store as normal customers and the kid wants some currency for both games cool this is normal i ring them out as usual they got a membership too sweet gave them their receipt with the cards and off they go with their day normal interaction per usual id expect they know how to redeem these cards dead wrong here about an hour later they called saying they dont know how to redeem the codes and asking me if theyre activated i told them yes and there should be instructions in the back of the card as well as tell them that checking out either robloxs website or watch youtube videos as a tutorial same with fortnite they said ok well do that thought that was the end after the conversation on the phone you know where this is going nope the grandparent and child came back to the store with the childs tablet and tells me its not working aka they didnt do anything but i try to help its a slow day slow paced store so i got time now the problems here start to overlay first roblox i have very little knowledge with this app so navigation is a slight learning curve problem grandparent and child does not know the login information for their own roblox account the mother set the information up with making their child an email address child was too young to understand how logins work so the grandparent had to call mother that didnt answer the phone to find information on how to gain access to the childs email account with no prevail the grandparent looks at me saying so how do i do this then internal facepalm apparently redeeming a roblox code isnt done through the app but through the website browser that took about minutes to figure that out now we just have to login through the web browser to redeem the code ok i look through my phone to see if google has a answer apparently there was another way to navigate though this process upon research you can access the account via time code setup problem time code setup gets sent to the email now the problem is where did it get sent to because there was an parental email setup now she had to call like people on who set this one up turns out they put it on the grandparents email address and you know what happens next i cant login to my email i dont know the password intenal reaction gdi thank gawd her email password reset verification is only though her phone via sms so we reset that password then get the code to access roblox and then we entered the roblox code in the account now funds are there problem this was a short fix converting the currency to robux had to google that one too now onto fortnite same problems different game they dont know the login information and also had to setup a parental account for epic games since the child had restricted access to enter fortnite codes so i had to do a step by step setup for her account so they can redeem fortnite currency fortnite is a little more tame but at this point im so internally frustrated it went as far as reinstalling the entire game because something got messed up from probably what the kid did before coming into the store that was another hours they were in store for about hours and then another hour after the installation thankfully they were patient i helped guests inbetween and answered the usual phone calls as they waited all tasks were done beforehand so its just helping the guests feel bad for the child must of been bored out of his mind trying to get his stuff fixed finally all of that is fixed after forever something time passes theyre good to go both cards are redeemed and the child can do what he wants to buy stuff on there week later grandparent calls complaining they need a verification code because the mother and child was trying to redeem points for an online purchase i told her i dont have access to that thats something thats emailed to you i deleted it i told her she can recover that in the trash folder in the email surprised surprised she didnt know how to find that i even told her that they can hit a button on the same page to resend verification they cant find it told them they can redo the process but concerned that its the same code in the trash and thought the new email will go in the email trash at this point i told her to tell the mother and child to go into their nearby gamestop store and have the rep assist them she tried to tell me that it may be better to have her call me to help them out at a different gamestop when theyre there i just said ill try end of conversation why is the grandparent doing all the work for this child who doesnt know much about technology and the mother is just not helping at all why cant the grandparent communicate with the mother to see if they have all the information needed just incase these things happen write all of this down how do you not know your passwords for all of your accounts make notes somewhere so you dont forget why even bother with all of this if no one is technology literate tldr seriously just tell the child that hes not old enough and let him do something else no point for them to go through all of this just to buy some cosmetics n stuff that will last him like days or just dont buy anything for him on these games if its too hard dont attempt sure technology is hard for people dont pop a vein and sanity for these types of scenarios sorry for the long post just frustrated with customers
